##Working on something here.

Not sure exactly what it will end up being, but for now I wanted to find a way to track and share [what games I’m currently playing](https://smallscreened.github.io/nowplaying).

My newsletter, [Small Screen](https://tinyletter.com/smallscreen) sends an email when a great game comes out, but I’m always exploring other things and think someone might be interested. Even if not, this has already proven to be a fun experiment in automation and learning how to build and maintain a simple game site entirely through iOS.
