The Star Dancer Saga

Ancient Lore
The first god we worshiped was Ernalda, the Earth Mother. 

Our clan’s earliest Famous Event was when Elmal won the Battle of Akashar. 

When the ice came to our city of Nivorah, we rode out, rather than hide under a dome. After several migrations, we settled along the right bank of the Black Eel River. There, our hero Beren married Redalda, a descendant of Orlanth. Beren and Redalda celebrated their union by riding to the Other Side. 

To help unify our people with the Rams, Redalda pledged to uphold the Rider virtue of ferocity. 

Beren and Redalda reigned for many years, warding their dwarf-built fort against trolls. They answered Orlanth’s call and rode out to fight a Chaos army. Beren fought with guile, but Stormfall was still a disastrous defeat. 

The clan managed to survive after the destruction of the Spike at the center of the world. 

King Vinglanth, the great-grandson of Beren and Redalda, lost the tribal regalia and his life fighting cannibals at the Blood Feast Battle.

When they would not join with us against Chaos, his son King Brolarulf the Sun raided the Forosilvuli tribe, souring our relations with them. 

Our gods Orlanth the Storm King and Ernalda the Earth Queen died. We continued to sacrifice to Ernalda. 

When other Berenethtelli clans flouted the authority of the king, we vowed to restore the tribe. 

Issaries, god of trade, and Lhankor Mhy, god of lore, died. We stopped sacrificing to Ernalda, Issaries, and Lhankor Mhy. 

Divinations taken when Iverlantho became king said that life will be about as bad as feared. They also revealed that the world would soon end, though not exactly when.


Iverlantho 5
There were no clear omens, but everyone knew that simply surviving another year would be difficult. 

Uvuli found members of Wakboth’s Chaos army skulking in our wildlands. We decided to drive them off. Taken by surprise, they withdrew in haste. 

Tyram cultists wanted to use our ritual grounds to climb their sky ladder. They said it would increase the might of our sky god worshipers. We agreed. A hole in the fumes opened up above our ritual ground. They climbed up their ladder and disappeared through it. The gap stayed open, and our fire worshipers felt might and wisdom surge through them. The ring warned the people to speak no more of this. 

Hanth said he could perform a blessing that would lure game away from our neighbors and into our wildlands. The ring agreed to let him call for the blessing. The improvement in our hunting yields became apparent right away. 

The Varleving clan wanted to make the Berenethtelli a real kingdom again. We sent delegates to help them sway other clans. The Varlevings discovered that clans who once were loyal to Beren were now reluctant, except in sentimental terms. But they treated us with respect, and gave us gifts. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

Orlmarth emissaries sought wergild for the death of their warrior Kangharl, slain by Kerenna. We paid the traditional compensation. Declaring the negotiation properly concluded, they departed. 

Outlanders called Balurgans, after their goddess, offered us an earth blessing in exchange for cows. We offered more than they asked. They accepted with delight, saying our blessing would last longer now. Sure enough, our fields and pastures hummed with life. Yet after a while the plants grew afraid, and told our shamans so. Balurga’s blessing had awakened a hunger in the earth. 

We sent a herd raid against the Kestangi, but were spotted. We were driven off and had no opportunity to obtain any loot. 

Clan nobles began discussing what we should do, besides trying to survive for as long as possible. We sent Reda to visit the Sky Racers. 

A punishing rainstorm deepened our gloom. We threw a feast. The people felt better with fuller bellies.


Iverlantho 6
The oracles predicted good foaling. 

Iverlantho’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level. 

Leika’s ability to provide food was acknowledged to be of heroic level. 

Brekun’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level. 

A Chaos army defeated a large army of trolls. 

Reda demanded annual tribute from the Sky Racers. They said they could not afford to pay. We lowered our demand, winning their acceptance. 

Our outer walls began to crumble. We invoked Elmal. Elmal filled the gaps in the wall with hot metal from his shield. It solidified quickly. 

We sent a herd raid against the Blackspears, but were detected. We drove the Blackspears from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

Our leading farmers noted that our fields were just beginning to show signs of exhaustion. 

People said the carpenter Sereden, who spoke in quiet riddles, deserved elevation. The ring cautioned people not to read too much into Sereden’s muddled words. Over time his disciples wearied of his fuzzy statements. 

Reda sought permission to take warriors through a hole in the world in search of the legendary horse Charandar. The ring granted it. 

We cleared fields and held a ceremony in memory of the Barley Goddess and Earth Mother. 

Zombies attacked a patrol. We called on Humakt. Our Death Rune adherents meditated on their swords, reporting this incident to their implacable deity. He built a fence of unseen swords to slash zombies and shatter skeletons whenever they dared approach. 

We began the ritual "Osara the Warrior." 

Leika couldn’t convince the women that they had the ability to fight. Leika stormed off in frustration. When Verlaro saw that she was so determined to fight that she would stand alone, he gladly let her take over the defense. 

As Leika left Verlaro, her path was blocked by a horrific antler monster made of several smaller monsters. She attacked it with her flaming spear. Although it had many arms, the monster’s single rack of antlers made it hard to maneuver, and Leika danced in and out, her bright spear sizzling into the monster’s slimy flesh. With a groan, it fell. 

That day, Leika showed why Osara was called "Flame Sister." Scorching flames danced across the battlefield, taking a heavy toll among the cat people. 

Overall, the ritual was a success. The women saluted Leika with blazing spears and said they would follow Flame Sister into battle. 

Uvuli and her party never returned from hunting for spirits to the northwest. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

The Blazing Runners wanted us to talk the Orlmarthings into withdrawing hospitality from bandits they were harboring. We said, "If they agree, you must pay us on the spot." They unhappily agreed. The Orlmarthings would not yield. 

Voskath and Randella died of old age. 

Our shaman Dresta proposed a rite that would increase our magic and aid us with spirits, possibly hurting us with the gods. We agreed. Dresta joined with our other shamans to perform a successful rite, swelling Berenstead with positive magic. The feared loss of connection to the gods had not occurred, she said.


Iverlantho 7
Our seers predicted that foragers would find plentiful food this year. 

Reda came back alone from her mission. It had gone disastrously wrong; all the warriors who went with her were killed. 

We reorganized the clan ring, making Brekun the new chief. 

Yinkin cultists reported Dresta’s growing fame. The ring toasted the cat cultists for bringing useful news. "We will tell others of Berenstead’s kindness," they replied. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. We plundered the Bull Stone. 

Wheels of the Ku-Rander clan accused us of damaging their temple. They demanded that we send a champion to take part in their rite. We heaped scorn on them. They rode off, repeating their threats. Filled with Leika’s furor, the people welcomed their coming attack. Then we would prove with swords what we had set out in words. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the field with a withering barrage of arrows. Backed by the Strongbow ritual, our skirmishing clearly hurt their confidence. 

Kerenna said she was going to kill Veris, the Ruby Gate chieftain, for his dealings with the dead. The clan wished her well. Kerenna succeeded, cleaving her way through Veris’s guard and sending him forever to the lightless Underworld. Humakt granted her speed and strength. 

Iverlantho, heir to the royal lineage of the Beren Tribe, insisted we make him chieftain, and treat him as a king. The ring said it would make him chief, after the recovery of the lost tribal regalia. We instructed our lore speakers to learn the secrets of lost royal regalia. They said they would look into this, by examining the carvings on our story wall. 

Blazing Run emissaries told us of cannibal Ergeshites, expecting us to hunt and kill them. We warned them against blaming innocent Ergeshites for the evil of a few. They promised to ensure that death was meted only to the deserving. 

One day, fire stopped working. We invoked Osara. The goddess shot blazing arrows down through the cloud layer. They struck invisible Chaos beasts, who groaned and whined. We lit tapers from the flame of her arrows and afterwards had no trouble lighting fires of our own. 

Koreng convinced the Sky Racer clan to create a new trading route. 

Conflict between Iverlantho and Reda distracted the clan from its duties. The rest of the ring sought to mediate between them. After much wrangling, the two finally proposed to forget their differences. 

Enothea and Leika died of old age. 

Koreng led a caravan to trade with the High Stallions. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Blackspears.


Iverlantho 8
Our cows were expected to give abundant milk. 

Our crops failed due to acid rain. We planted a second crop. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

Devil cultists offered us a prayer to divert an imminent Chaos attack. We treated their offer with the scorn it deserved. As they left, they called out, "Wakboth shall feast on your eyes!" People took heart in our refusal to be cowed. 

Walktapi and other Chaos foes attacked. Dresta summoned wolf and badger spirits, and sent them to nip at the walktapi. Eventually the surviving Chaos army scattered. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

Disputes again broke out between royalists and realists. To ease tensions, the ring called for a kite-flying contest. The air, stagnant at first, lofted our colorful kites into the air. People remembered that, whatever they thought of a royal revival, they were all Star Dancers. 

Our lore speakers said they had figured out where our lost royal regalia might be. The ring promised to send explorers. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Jade Colts. 

Many of our horses were no longer eating, unless it was each other. We invoked Redalda. The goddess sent fiery stallions to trample the Chaos shards embedded in the bones of our horses. 

The Varlevings brought Delmara as a bride for King Iverlantho. Delmara’s kin praised our generosity at the wedding feast. Iverlantho beamed with joy. 


Iverlantho 9
The oracles said we should explore distant lands this year. 

Koreng convinced the Blackspear clan to create a new trading route. 

Kerenna’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level. 

Skeletons attacked our foragers. We called on Urox. Our bull cultists threw bones in a bag and crushed them underfoot. The undead were of Chaos, and thus Urox’s foes. The god warded us against Chaos. 

Sereden expressed worry over Iverlantho’s state of mind and suggested we place the king under his tutelage. The rest of the ring told him to forget this disastrous idea. Sereden posed a few obscure questions, but did not appear perturbed by the refusal. 

Outlaws threatened our exploration party in the northeast. Kerenna and her forces killed and scattered them. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. Poison clouds drifted down to the ground. Aski called on Urox the Searing Wind. Urox had bigger worries than stupid clouds, and left us to handle the problem on our own. Aski commanded that we should use the fog as cover. We tried to befriend the fog, but it did not befriend us. Both sides suffered, fighting in poor conditions, before it finally dissipated. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

The Four Drums made a deal with cultists of the Chaos god Tyram the Broken. We sent Koreng out to look for eager Uroxi. He contacted an Uroxi band led by Theskan the Crusher. Not long after they returned carrying the severed heads of the Tyram cultists. As was their custom, they instructed us to support their mission with generous gifts. 

Our spirits offered to look on us favorably, if we pleased them. We gave them a story. One tale of Orlanth led to another, then another. When we mentioned Elmal, we had to tell all his tales, too, and those of Hyalor and the exodus. When dawn came, they yawned and said, "You have more than earned your boon." The spirits said their special favor would last for a glimmerglad. They do not comprehend time as we do but Dresta thought this meant four years. 

Hanth and his party never returned from foraging to the northwest. 

Delegates of the Varleving clan proposed alliance. We agreed. 

Cannibal ghosts ambushed our regalia-hunting expedition. Kerenna’s explorers defended themselves and won, but four of them came back injured. 

One day our maps all went blank. We called on Redalda to restore the maps. A galloping sound filled the royal hall. Pens flew through the air to re-ink the maps. Studying the maps, Sereden saw what others could not. He slumped unconscious to the floor. On awakening, he said he’d seen a time not so far away when not just the maps but the world itself would vanish. Only a realm of eternal night, where nearly everyone was dead, would remain. "When that happens, these maps may help one of us find a way." 

Reda sought alliance with the Sky Racers. Reda rode with them, singing songs of Hyalor, and we became allies. 

The Varleving clan paid the upkeep on our Humakt shrine for the year. The ring toasted them in the royal hall. They particularly basked in compliments paid by Koreng and Aleen. 

We were unable to raid the Ku-Randeri due to a winter storm.


Iverlantho 10
The clan’s magic was not as strong as usual this year. 

Kerenna and our explorers found the supposed site of the Blood Feast Battle. There they spotted the remains of a trade delegation, and a wagon containing barrels of salt fish. 

Offir threw the emblems and saw auspicious signs for a solar rite. The ring reproved Offir for taking the emblems without permission. People were glad to see the ring speak up for proper protocol. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri. An Elmali warrior came toward Enfrew, bearing radiant shield and sword. Enfrew thought, "I shall dim his light with the shadow of death." That day it was the brightness of Elmal, not the shadow of Humakt, that won the day. A glowing guardian sword slashed Enfrew until he dropped wounded to the gore-flecked ground. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. We seized the Spirit Necklace. 

The Orlmarthings raided us for seven cows while we were raiding. 

Iverlantho’s new wife Delmara gave birth to an heir, calling him Venef. We celebrated the renewal of the royal line. The words of the ring disposed the people toward Iverlantho and his desire to revive true kingship at Berenstead. 

Kerenna’s exploration party spotted very strange outlanders. We demanded a gift. "An understandable request from Chaos Age Orlanthi," said their leader, a stout man with a wattle-like chin. He pointed an implement at Kerenna. "This will grant you good fortune for the next year. Now please desist in troubling us, so that we may continue our measurements." 

The Fireflower clan wanted help against slave-takers who followed the Chaos god Ompalam. We sent warriors. Our combined force found the Ompalamites, and the battle was joined. The sound thrashing the enslavers received taught them that our valley was not their hunting ground. 

The farmer Ingard killed his brother Rangor, later saying he had been possessed by Chaos. We called on Urox to scourge Chaos from him. Hot winds buffeted and scalded Ingard, burning out the Chaos. The ring declared him innocent. Members of the dominant royalist faction praised the ring for following the truth. Their opponents said that the ring had put politics above justice and wisdom. Yes, he had been scourged of Chaos, they said, but surely the rest of the family should not have to look at Rangor’s murderer every day. 

Odayla worshipers from the Deleskaring clan challenged our hunters to a wager. We declined.


Iverlantho 11
Our oracles said we would be raided. 

In Balurgan territory, their high priestess asked Brekun to take a prisoner of the Fireflower clan. He agreed. Our explorers found an unsuspecting Fireflower farmer and had him subdued before he knew what was happening. Brekun turned the Fireflower over to the Balurgans, receiving the promised reward. 

Dresta was acclaimed a shaman among shamans. 

Our leading farmers noted that our fields were starting to show signs of exhaustion. 

The Trolls raided us. The trolls brought a gigantic spider onto the battlefield. It ate one of our Bows. Koreng fought the spider with hunter’s guile. The shamans sped the rhythm of their drumming, preventing Koreng from luring it out. While he was distracted, the trolls escalated their assault. We were driven from the battlefield and looted. 

Our raiders discovered that Orlmarth lands were missing. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

A duck trader offered silver for our craft goods. We agreed. Extolling the workmanship of our crafters, we inspired him to up his offer. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Four Drums. 

We cleared fields and held a ceremony in memory of the Barley Goddess and Earth Mother. 

The Grey Wings tried to turn our allies, the Sky Racers, against us. We thanked the Sky Racers for letting us know. They returned our fulsome praise, and rode in circles and gave the good whoop. 

Marele visited other Orlanthi clans, looking for people willing to join the Star Dancers. She managed to convince six people to pack up and move. They brought with them three children. Our people grumbled that we had gotten the dregs of the other clans. 

We were unable to conduct a raid against the Grey Wings due to a winter storm. 

Kerenna explored the region between the valley and the Imther mountains. Jajalarings challenged us but recognized Kerenna as a Death worshiper. They said they would grant us a great reward if we would dispose of a band of disease witches laired in a nearby cave. Kerenna followed their directions and indeed found the disease witches, taking them by surprise. We pressed our advantage hard, and they never rallied. It took some time to find the wandering dog folk who had charged us with this mission. When we showed them the heads of their enemies, they gave us a magic amulet, the Bone-Chewing Dog. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us for 23 cows. 

Old age carried Koreng away. 


Iverlantho 12
The oracles said we should explore distant lands this year. 

We reorganized the clan ring, making Iverlantho the new chief. 

King Iverlantho said the other clans of the Beren tribe should recognize his kingship. We instructed our lore speakers to learn the secrets of lost royal regalia. The lore speakers said yes, in a way that meant no. When we pressed them, they grudgingly assented. 

Walktapi and other Chaos foes attacked. Kerenna led the defense from inside Berenstead. We kept a few of our warriors in reserve, assigning the rest to the walls. While some of the Chaos army tarried by the gates, most of the walktapi straggled off to despoil our land. They tore apart a barn. They found some of our farmers, and tore them to pieces. Afterwards, we realized that the horde of Chaos creatures had damaged our hunting grounds. 

We raided the Grey Wings with help from the Sky Racer clan. We drove the Grey Wings from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

We performed the Decade Rite, gaining audience with Elmal, who told us that our survival was as great as any past victory. We sought protection from loss of respect. Elmal granted this. 

Brekun explored the Invaress region of Forosan, fighting off skeletons. Returning home, the explorers stumbled across a Berry spirit, desperate to escape that terrible land. 

Dara Happans showed up asking for food and temporary shelter. We agreed to help them. Our people treated them with contempt. When asked why, they said, "We can’t afford to give food to others." 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Mor-Kagini. 

Dresta called for a mission to lean on the Andaylings. The ring distanced itself from Dresta’s dudgeon. These words merely reinforced the peoples’ respect for Dresta. 

We were raided by the Trolls. The troll leader, a flame-wreathed Death Lord, advanced on Nyalesta. Nyalesta advanced, matching our Death rune mastery against his. The Death Lord sheared through Nyalesta’s armor, seriously wounding her. The trolls pressed us back. We drove the Trolls off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

The marriage of Amilanth and Jenarma, from the Urkarning clan, was just the latest to fail, but was complicated by her insistence on being repaid her dowry. The Sky Racers agreed to mediate the dispute. Their negotiators persuaded the Urkarnings to drop Jenarma’s demand. 

A doorway leading to the Gods War was discovered to the northeast. Explorers sensed the powers of the Wilderness rune and the Earth and Death runes. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. Strongbow 

We learned that the Chov-Ashdae had the Berenbane banner, long thought destroyed. We offered to trade for it. They accepted our offer, allowing us to destroy it, once and for all. 

Enfrew died of old age. 

Aleen’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level.


Iverlantho 13
The seers said we would have better than usual luck on our raids this year. 

Balurgans wanted us to help them capture a Blackspear, to trade for their young god-talker held hostage. We agreed to help. Brekun led them to the periphery of the Blackspear lands and aided the Balurgans in ambushing their foragers. They took a young man and rode off, promising we would receive the blessing they had promised. Our priestesses soon affirmed that their goddess had kept up her part of the bargain. Though the blessing greened our pastures and enriched our fields, in time we felt uneasy about it. The spirits detected nothing awry, so we attributed it to pangs of troubled conscience. 

We sought Humakt in the Gods War. Kerenna stepped forward, and was chosen. We hoped that Humakt would fill our sword-arms with death. 

Kerenna meditated on her blade and rode toward the clamor of death. Looking down at her sword, she saw that it was blooded, and that a warrior of the Four Drum clan lay dead at her feet. A life claimed, she was able to find and step into a timeless time. Kerenna perceived the cosmic mountain, on which stood the primal war god Kargan Tor. He said, "I fight with certitude." Long after Humakt’s brothers had given up, Kerenna fought Kargan Tor one hundred times. At the end of this Humakt knew how to fight. 

At Kargan Tor’s urging, Kerenna meditated for a year at the Gate of Introspection. She sought the secret of Insight. The contemplation felt like a year and aged Kerenna like ten. She would forever after feel like a tantalizing truth lay just beyond grasping. 

Kerenna saw Eurmal discover Death and raise it to hit Grandfather Mortal. Humakt took the sword, and did what had to be done to bring Death into the world. Grandfather Mortal became the essential sacrifice. Kerenna had found the unpopular and fearsome truth, and had not shirked from it. The power of death settled into Kerenna. 

Kerenna chose to participate as Humakt broke his family ties to thieving Orlanth. Humakt’s act of severance reverberated from the story wall, sowing disunity in Berenstead. 

Kerenna, as Humakt, gathered up the sword Orlanth had broken. Zorak Zoran had one of the biggest pieces. Kerenna issued an honorable challenge. The troll god laughed and threw darkness in Humakt’s eyes. "Your obsession with honor will be the death of you yet, brother." The darkness spirit lunged at Kerenna, seizing the advantage of surprise. Kerenna fought off the darkness spirit, gathering more pieces of the sword. "You win this one, brother," said the troll god. 

Humakt cut a vast chasm between life and death, leaving the undead on one side. He then began to destroy them. Kerenna launched herself into a skeleton horde. She knocked skulls from spines and blew ribcages apart. Foes who sought to distract Humakt could not reach him. 

Humakt praised Kerenna’s support as tactically essential. "Clasp my reward as tightly as you would clasp your sword," the Death Dealer said. In a journey both fast and slow, Kerenna traveled from the edge of Humakt’s chasm back to Berenstead. 

Kerenna had truly earned the war blessing she sought. 

Our lore speakers said they had figured out where our lost royal regalia might be. We sent explorers right away. 

Members of the Four Drum clan demanded redress for the warrior Kerenna killed on the way to the Gods War. We gave it to them. They said we had done the right thing. 

A duck trader, who had swindled the Kestangi, offered us a similar exchange of craft goods for silver. Reda turned the duck over to the Kestangi clan. They thanked us eloquently and, in a gesture of fellowship, gave us what the duck had stolen from them. 

We stole 25 cows from the Urkarnings. 

The Porganosi clan brought a legal dispute with the Kestangi before the king. Iverlantho ruled in favor of the Porganosi clan. 

Kerenna entered the Gods War, finding a fork leading to two divine beings. She went underground to find an Earth goddess who did not die. 

Kerenna went to the mound of Remaining Earth, who demanded a gift. Kerenna offered magic. Our magic entered Remaining Earth’s earth mound. A quenching rain fell upon it, and sprouts grew from its darkened sides. 

Our questers encountered the disease goddess Malia. Kerenna attacked with the fury of Storm Bull. Seeing the wind of Urox wreathed around the questers, Malia vanished. Her victims recovered. They gave Kerenna an amulet of gratitude that would protect the questers as they continued through the Other World. 

Kerenna beheld First Horse. She beckoned her, saying, "Redalda knew how to ride you." "I thought you looked vaguely familiar," said First Horse. "It is the way your eyes are set." She agreed to seek the safety of Orlanthstead, and we went on our way. 

The questers found Nontraya building soldiers for his Undead Army. Kerenna attacked with Humakt’s cold hatred of the undead. Kerenna’s sword impaled Nontraya’s bony chest. The Undead God staggered off. Not yet animated by his blasphemous power, his abandoned soldiers were easy to hack apart. 

Kerenna asked the goddess to bless our fields. "I shall fill them with nourishment," said Remaining Earth. 

Nyalesta led a caravan to trade with the Varlevings. 

Generations of ancestors battled one another in the royal hall, with the older Rider spirits fighting our later Ram forbears. We reminded our Ram ancestors that we began as Riders. Our ancestors stopped fighting to listen to the tale of the exodus from the golden city, as led by Hyalor. Moved by this tale of bravery and survival, Redalda’s ancestors laid down their spectral blades and granted a blessing. It would strengthen our storm devotees when adversity tested them. 

Dead air left all our Orlanth worshipers gasping to breathe, and killed two. Mammoth spirits answered our shamans, spraying breathable air through their trunks. About half of our Orlanth worshipers recovered. The others felt better, but still too winded to do much. 

Our explorers are back, without the regalia you sent them to find. They did happen upon a mound where someone had buried containers of dried berries.


Iverlantho 14
The leaves of the oak trees fell off early, but nobody agreed what this signified. 

Outlaws threatened our exploration party in the north. Brekun and his forces killed and scattered them. 

Baranwolf performed a rite that stole crop fertility from the Ruby Gates. We sent Reda to the Ruby Gates with compensation. Though the offense Baranwolf had caused was great, Reda was eventually able to mollify them. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri with help from the Varleving clan. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

The Fireflowers stole eight cows while we were raiding. 

We stole 34 cows from the Fireflowers. 

We learned that the Ku-Randeri had declared a feud against us. 

In the Imther mountains our explorers encountered hostile dwarves, who attacked us. They quickly came to regret their rashness. We slew four of them. The rest fled, leaving behind a cart, containing the spoils of our victory. Only one of us was wounded. Brekun found gems and metals worth 31 cows. 

Yinkin worshipers offered to chase away fear. The ring accepted, toasting them in the royal hall. Our mood lightened, and the people looked well upon our leaders. 

Riders from a faraway land came asking to be taken in. We agreed. 

We sent Nyalesta to the Sky Racers to try to buy a treasure. She bought the Horn of Urox. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

Scorpion folk came to take our sheep. We sent a war party after them. Brekun found them and the rest of their brood as they feasted on our sheep. In the ensuing battle, they sank their poisoned stingers into five of our warriors. In the end, we slew them and burned their corpses.


Iverlantho 15
The signs for calving looked bad. 

Our crops failed due to smut. We planted a second crop. 

A duck trader offered to sell us a piece of the royal regalia, the Horn of Vingkot. We accepted. We took possession of the horn, and for several hours after the duck’s departure, we thought it true. Then it decayed into a heap of sawdust. The duck was a charlatan and an Eurmalist, and we had been swindled! 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. An Elmali warrior came toward Sereden, bearing radiant shield and sword. Sereden thought, "I shall dim his light with storm." Sereden flew at him, lofted on pure, clean clouds of lordly authority. The boldest of blows slew him on the spot. The Ku-Randeri fell into disorder. We sent more of them to escort the Elmali champion to the realm of the dead. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

A chorus of voices said that Kerenna should join the ring. The ring said they would elevate her. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

Hunters found a statue of Ragnaglar in our wildlands. Divination revealed that the statue had been dumped on our lands by the Genadari. We demanded that they retrieve their statue. They pretended that they had not done it. 

The warriors refused to raid the Genadari without a larger group. 

Aleen found members of Wakboth’s Chaos army skulking in our wildlands. We sought to capture them. When they saw we meant to take them alive, they resisted us all the more. Ten of us sustained injuries in the struggle. Some foes died in the skirmish. We dragged the survivors to Berenstead for interrogation. In the end they confessed that they had come to the valley to draw its clans into the worship of their world-smashing god. 

Now that we knew what Wakboth’s minions were up to, we had to decide what to do about it. We passed on the warning to clans throughout the valley. They thanked us for this vital information. Wakboth would find no worshipers in our valley. 

Leading herders noted that our pastures were starting to show signs of damage from overgrazing. 

We were raided by the Ku-Randeri. Nyalesta found herself in a position to kill multiple foes. She cut down many of them. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

We learned that everyone in the Eyes of Gold clan had disappeared.


Iverlantho 16
The leaves of the oak trees fell off early, but nobody agreed what this signified. 

Dresta gained us magic by winning a fight against a Wailing Wind spirit. 

A group of Eyes of Golds begged to be taken in after their land mysteriously became vacant. We took adopted them. 

We asked the Varlevings to offer a gift on our behalf to the Ku-Rander clan. The Ku-Randeri refused to accept it, let alone end their feud. 

Cannibals and other Chaos foes attacked. Calling on Humakt to guide her sword, Kerenna entered a trance-like state, and danced through the Chaos army, striking to left and right. Finally, the attackers could take no more of this. They hightailed it for home. Chadoro, who we adopted after the demise of the Eyes of Gold clan, distinguished himself in the fighting. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

Reda demanded annual tribute from the Andaylings. They acceded to our demand. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Grey Wings. We drove the Grey Wings from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

We raided the Genadari. The chief Genadari healer demanded surcease, so that both auxiliaries could heal their warriors. Sereden said, "Only if you surrender, giving us goods worth 15 cows." She conferred with the Genadari war leader, who laughed and shook his head. Sereden said, "You may heal your survivors after we have won." "You have a right to say that," remarked the priestess. We were driven off and had no opportunity to pillage. 

Ancestors praised the chieftain. As they requested, Iverlantho addressed the people. He spoke of the need for flexible thinking in unprecedented times. Though the people did not quite see what Iverlantho was talking about, they accepted the endorsement the ancestors had given him. 

Our hunters complained that young Hanvan would not share the secrets of his success. The clan said, "This is not a matter for the clan ring." 

An Uroxi war band offered to shatter the Ragnaglar statue to dust. We agreed, but would provide half the reward a year from now. After some muttered complaints, they danced and bellowed and a searing wind blew up to turn the statue to dust. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. Brekun found himself able to kill many of the foe. He struck down a good number of them. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

Our pastures had been grazed for many years, and were no longer as productive. 

Our outer walls began to crumble. We sought the aid of spirits. Spirits entered the walls, restoring stone and mortar.


Iverlantho 17
The oracles said any children born this year would have great destinies. 

Wakboth flooded the land. Our bull stompers pointed at Wakboth and bellowed to the horizons. Answering their call, Storm Bull flew through the sickening clouds, dispersing them with his hot wind. He and the Devil did battle. Smashing Wakboth, then flying away, Urox lured the pursuing Devil from our lands. The water covering our fields receded to its home in the river. 

We stole 20 cows from the Ku-Randeri. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri. The Ku-Randeri managed to withdraw while we performed a ritual. We seized Orlanth’s Pyre-Ash. 

Vingkara began trying to restore our overgrazed pastures, but it was clear that it would take at least another year of work, or perhaps a sacrifice to Uralda. 

Redalda told Reda in a dream that she could end a feud with the Ku-Randeri by riding the Partial Path. We agreed, giving her magic to take with her. People said, "I would feel better about this if she was riding something called the Complete Path." 

Reda arrived at the clan lands of the Ku-Randeri. She rode forth, trusting that they would have received the needful omens. The Ku-Randeri lowered their bows and bade Reda to approach. The Ku-Randeri told Reda that an old foe of theirs would soon return to their lands. Reda did not know how she would stop this enemy, but realized that the answer must lie on the Partial Path. "I will ride and find victory for us both," she said. 

Baranwolf stole milk magic from the Varlevings. The ring admonished Baranwolf. People were happy to receive the blessing and didn’t care that it was stolen. 

Uralda’s magic improved our pastures, but couldn’t completely restore their productivity. 

The Uroxi came back to demand payment of our debt. We gave them the full amount. "You have given what was due," they said. 

Reda rode to Redalda, who asked her to tell of Berenstead, and why it deserved her gift. Reda said, "We find new ways, just like you did." "That indeed is the only path to survival," Redalda said. The goddess gave her the secret of the runaround, which would help her lead the Twisted Ones from the lands of the Ku-Randeri. 

The Porganosi requested a favor, asking for food since they were in the tribe. We gave them what they asked for. 

Uralda’s magic improved our pastures, but couldn’t completely restore their productivity. 

Andayling emissaries came to worship and discuss how the world was getting darker and colder. We talked up the ability of a strong tribe to pool resources. They were open to the idea, as long as other clans agreed too. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled.


Iverlantho 18
The clan would see endless squabbles in the coming year, according to the oracles. 

Returning from the Partial Path to Ku-Rander territory, Reda encountered the Twisted Ones, using the runaround maneuver to scatter them. Remnant leaders surrounded her. Charging, her escort shouted the name of Urox, Chaos smiter. They fell as all thralls of Chaos must. The Ku-Randeri ended their feud with us. We agreed that neither would attack the other. 

Uralda’s magic restored our pastures. 

One day our maps all went blank. We called on owl spirits to guide the hands of our map makers. Owl spirits flew to Dresta and promised to do their best. Then they went out through the valley, returning to hoot gently into the ears of our map makers. They restored the maps to crude but acceptable condition. 

Reda demanded annual tribute from the Ku-Randeri. Reda’s words convinced them they had best pay the tribute. 

We were raided by the Grey Wings. They offered to parley before the battle. They asked for tribute, and we paid a lesser amount. 

We stole 28 cows from the Grey Wings. 

The Oslira River was no longer tame. We prepared for a ritual. 

Exploring the Autumn Mountains, Brekun found some old gear, which was worth a little. 

Our leading farmers noted that our fields were starting to show signs of exhaustion. 

We cleared fields and held a ceremony in memory of the Barley Goddess and Earth Mother. 

King Vusdelos of Forosan offered us a blessing against sky followers in exchange for later assistance against the Undead Army. The ring’s answer came loud and clear: "We follow both storm and sky, you ragged scoundrels!" They recoiled in haughty affront. Though the people disliked the insult against sky worship implied by their blessing, they had still hoped we would aid against the Undead Army. 

The Genadari raided us for 26 cows. 

Weeders asked us to dissuade the Andayling clan from raiding them. Reda went to persuade the Andaylings to desist. "We don’t understand why you protect them, but it is enough that you do." The Weeders promised to repay us with dried fish in about a year.


Iverlantho 19
We predicted a bitterly cold Dark season. 

We no longer had the worshipers to support our shrine to Urox. 

We began the "Taming the River" ritual to deal with the wild Oslira River. 

Reda saw a blue dragon raging outside the Golden City. Reda tried to use cunning, but was not able to divert the dragon. 

Reda found herself facing a pride of sakkars. As divine beings, the sakkars were willing to bargain. In exchange for her life, Reda had to let the divine sakkars hunt in our land for one year. 

Reda was again blocked by sakkars. Reda sang lullabies, ballads, harvest songs, and finally half-remembered children’s songs. When she tried to leave, the sakkars stood and growled, and she had to sing some more. By the time they let her go, years had passed, and Reda could barely croak. 

The blue dragon returned to the Golden City, but Reda was there to confront it. Reda seduced the dragon. Eventually, she got Arcos to promise to flow only along the path they had traveled together. 

The blue dragon returned yet again to the Golden City. Reda commanded the dragon to withdraw. Fearful of the power of the celestial gods, it agreed to flow peacefully. 

Reladivus thanked Reda for putting the Arcos back in its place, and granted us mastery over the Oslira River. 

Factions for and against tribal renewal fell into bitter dissension. For this curse, we blamed the Genadari. Those affected said, "It felt more like spirits than a curse." 

We raided the Genadari, eluding their patrols. Baranwolf found himself able to kill many of the foe. He took out many of them. We drove the Genadari from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

Varlevings offered us a tablet of Hyalor. We said we might be interested, at a lower price. They said we could have it for 30 cows worth. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Deleskarings. 

Ancestors offered us a three-year blessing. We sought a talking blessing. This the ancestors granted, to the relief of our beleaguered people. 

Devil cultists offered us a prayer to divert an imminent Chaos attack. Kerenna led the fight against them. We cut them down, and the people exulted. Only four of our warriors were hurt. 

Broos and other Chaos foes attacked. Calling on Humakt to guide her sword, Kerenna entered a trance-like state, and danced through the Chaos army, striking to both sides. Finally, the attackers could take no more of this. They hightailed it for home. 


Iverlantho 20
The oracles predicted good foaling. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Ar-Tarimae. They were pleased with our generosity. They said that we were their friends, and that we could call on them in the future if we needed to. 

Vorvadrus’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level. 

Former merchants of the Varleving clan said they would be ending our trade arrangement, because commerce itself was dying. The ring choose not to act. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Kestangi. They said that we were their friends, and that we could call on them in the future if we needed to. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Genadari. They offered to parley before the battle. We exchanged taunts. Realizing that they could not prevail against us, the Genadari fled for home before we closed with them. 

We raided the Genadari, eluding their patrols. An Orlanthi champion flew up from the Genadari ranks, but fell to earth, unable to draw breath. Korstardos called on the memory of Orlanth to fill his lungs. Color returned to the Orlanthi flyer’s face as he gulped in pure, holy air. He rose to his feet but kept his sword lowered. Ancestors on our storm side blessed us for our piety. We would fight with strength for the remainder of this battle, and in the year ahead. We drove the Genadari from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

Vorvadrus went to the Whisperlands and found the place overrun with undead--mostly skeletons and zombies, but also the occasional vampire and ghoul. He managed to keep one step ahead of them, and never had to fight. In the end we found buried gems and metals worth 29 cows. 

Zarkorde the Star of the Ruby Gate clan asked us to help raid the Grey Wings. Our warriors took part in a one-sided fight. Zarkorde the Star praised them, and sent them home with a share of the loot. 

Nyalesta convinced the Andayling clan to create a new trading route. 

A duck trader offered silver for our craft goods. We seized his goods. We sent him packing, then counted up silver worth 22 cows. Some expected it to reveal itself as spirit silver and crumble to dust, but it did not. 

Our emissaries discovered that Blazing Run lands were completely empty of people. 

A narrow opening leading to the Gods War was discovered to the northwest. Explorers sensed the powers of the Illusion rune and the Fire rune. 

Yinkin worshipers offered us a blessing against rats. We agreed, inviting them to feast with us. Phantom cats bolstered the efforts of our own alynxes. At the feast, Yinkin folk performed acrobatic feats and contested with our hunters in feats of dexterity. An unexpected feeling settled upon the people. After a while, they realized it was joy. 

Arguments over tribal revival woke the ghosts of our ancestors, who echoed our conflict with a battle in the royal hall. We threw a feast for them. At first Hyaloring ancestors drank with the doubters, and Vingkotling ancestors with the royalists. But as the ale took hold we all mingled and remembered that we were Star Dancers first and foremost. The spirits departed, leaving us with a gift of magic.


Iverlantho 21
The oracles said any children born this year would have great destinies. 

A vampire attacked Sereden. Kerenna killed the monster, but Sereden would become one of them if we didn’t take steps. We called on spirits to heal the vampire sickness. Spirits entered Sereden’s body, swimming in his veins, crushing the hundreds of tiny vampires coursing through him. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Chov-Ashdae. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us for 32 sheep. 

The Oro-Tagini acknowledged the glory of the Chaos god Teghern. They chose the Jade Colts as his victims, and he slew half their elite warriors. Reda went to convince them to renounce Teghern. They said they already regretted what they had done, but could not see a way to atone. We said they had to outlaw the leaders who counseled the crime. Their wily chieftain, Jevon, rejected this out of hand. We told them to send warriors to the Jade Colt clan, to replace those slain by Teghern. The pious chieftain of the Jade Colt clan agreed. The Oro-Tagini and Jade Colts took joint part in a rite to turn Teghern’s subversion into unity. Thus was Chaos turned back and the Eater of Skin humbled. Both clans credited us for inspiring this act of atonement. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

The Genadari raided us for 21 cows. 

The marriage of Angvot and Gerara, from the Genadari clan, was just the latest to fail, but was complicated by her insistence on being repaid her dowry. The Sky Racers agreed to mediate the dispute. Their negotiators persuaded the Genadari to drop Gerara’s demand. 

Vorvadrus entered the Gods War, finding a fork leading to two divine beings. He sought the citadel in the sky, where Elmal patrolled. 

Vorvadrus came upon Elmal protecting Orlanthstead from missiles of living Chaos. Vorvadrus said, "Let me bear your shield awhile, so you may rest." Vorvadrus took Elmal’s place for as long as he could bear. It did not seem like long enough, but when the Steadfast Guardian returned, he looked younger and all his wounds had healed. "You lasted longer than others," said Elmal, "and deserve reward." But before he could speak another word, the instability of the Divine World pulled Vorvadrus elsewhere. 

Pocharngo, god of Primal Chaos, barred the questers’ path. Vorvadrus resolved to burn it with the flame of Elmal. Fire leapt from the questers’ blades to scorch and sizzle the gorpgod. It collapsed in on itself, allowing the party to pass. Pocharngo hissed in pain, knowing that Berenstead stood against its spread. 

The questers found divine prisoners in the labyrinth of Ompalam, Stealer of Freedom. They were about to release them when Ompalam entered the chamber. Our questers attacked Ompalam from behind. Vorvadrus got a blade around his neck and cut open a vein. The Slaver God rushed from his prison, clutching his throat and screaming curses in an outland tongue. 

Broos confronted Vorvadrus and his questers. Vorvadrus resolved to fight with the power of hope. The monsters drew strength from cruelty. It was powerful, but not as potent as our hope. 

The questers found Elmal again. Our efforts had aided him against Chaos, and he offered us a gift. Vorvadrus said, "Strengthen my shield and sword." "When you take a blow," said Elmal, "I shall bear its brunt. When you strike a blow, I shall fill it with my flame." 

A woman of the Varleving clan accused a young Star Dancer mother of stealing her baby. We called on owl spirits to find the truth. Owl spirits swooped invisibly into view to fly around the two women. They hooted that the true mother was Dorenna, of our clan. We refused to surrender the child. Refusing to admit the plain truth of our owl divination, the Varleving delegation said, "There is only one way to resolve this injustice." We knew this meant war. 

The Kestangi stole 17 cows. 

Nyalesta led a caravan to trade with the Porganosi. 

The Varlevings raided us. As the battle started to turn our way, Aski saw Varleving thieves leaving our citadel with a treasure. He intercepted them. They fled before his might, dropping their prize, Orstan’s Saw. But without Aski to engage the foe, the main Varleving force cut deeply into our defenders. We were driven from the battlefield and looted. 

We were raided by the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 


Iverlantho 22
We were unable to perform any combat rituals during Sacred Time. 

In Forosan Vorvadrus encountered locals hard pressed by jack-o-bears. The beasts roared in outrage as we rode into them, swords swinging. They fled before our buffeting blows, though not before one of us was killed and another four wounded. The Forosilvuli thanked us for saving them, offering us a treasure, a dagger-like tooth from one of the region’s legendary tigers, called the Tooth of Forosan. Later, Dresta studied it and said it was one of the Four Kingdoms treasures. If we located the treasure of each of the southern kingdoms, we would gain a diplomacy blessing. 

Our crops failed due to rust. We planted a second crop. 

Baranwolf led the common folk in the Seven Nights of Japery, bringing joy to the people. Iverlantho praised Baranwolf with a formal toast. Thus the king showed an understanding of Eurmal’s rough joys. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri. Loricon saw that the Ku-Randeri had arrayed their archers to deliver a fearsome fusillade. Loricon called on Valind to knock their arrows from the air. As we did not typically seek the aid of Orlanth’s outlaw nephew, Loricon was not surprised when his call went unheard. Their arrows rained down on us, and we suffered greatly. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

We performed the Decade Rite. We sought protection from population loss. Elmal granted this. 

We raided the Genadari, eluding their patrols. Offir found himself able to kill multiple foes. They turned out to be tougher than he expected. We drove the Genadari from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

The Grey Wings stole 33 cows. 

Dead air left all our Orlanth worshipers gasping to breathe, and killed two. Mammoth spirits answered our shamans, spraying breathable air through their trunks. About half of our Orlanth worshipers recovered. The others felt better, but still too out of breath to do much. 

Exploring Penentan, Vorvadrus spoke to the inhabitants of a community repairing homes ravaged by Chaos and bandits during their time hunkered down in Penentelada. They said that Berenethtelli bandits needn’t scour their realm, which had beaten Chaos and could surely beat the people of a defunct kingdom. On the way back we here and there found strewn antlers, picking up the best of them, worth eight cows. 

Nyalesta led a caravan to trade with the Jade Colts. 

Followers of Sereden called for the ring to honor his son Serestev, on the occasion of his initiation into manhood. We gifted his services to another clan. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

Serestev returned early from the Sky Racer clan, which didn’t want his skills or teachings. 

In the stolen sky we watched Eurmal the trickster god slaughtered by Wakboth. We gave Baranwolf our memories of Eurmal, to preserve their magic. Runes of Disorder and Illusion materialized to enter Baranwolf’s soul. He glowed with divine energy.


Iverlantho 23
The omens implied a good year for our hunters. 

We foraged to the northwest and found enough food for about half a season. 

The eye of Wakboth filled the sky. We sought aid from other clans. Clans who worshiped Urox sent their own bull stompers. Those who did not sent sacrifices, and bolstered us with magic. Lifted by the aid of the valley clans, our bull stompers successfully invoked Urox, who sent the eye away. Though far from final, this victory would grant surcease for a time, at least. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. The Ku-Randeri managed to withdraw while our magicians performed a ritual. 

We were raided by the Genadari. They offered to parley before the battle. We refused their demand for tribute. Kerenna found herself able to kill many of the foe. She cut down a good number of them. Poison clouds drifted down to the ground. Kerenna called on Urox the Searing Wind. Urox had bigger worries than stupid clouds, and left us to handle the problem on our own. We pulled back. The Genadari called off their raid. 

We raided the Genadari, eluding their patrols. Vorvadrus found himself able to kill multiple foes. He cut down a good number of them. Reda saw that the Genadari had arrayed their missile force to deliver a fearsome fusillade. Reda called on Valind to knock their slingstones from the air. Valind answered Reda’s plea. When the Genadari fired, an icy blast diverted the slingstones. Surprised, they fell into disarray. We pressed our advantage. We drove the Genadari from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

Aleen agitated for a raid against the Ruby Gates. The ring agreed, promising a raid. "We will smash the cult of Vivamort!" people cried. 

Our leading farmers noted that our fields were starting to show signs of exhaustion. 

Reda saw a hole in the world out in the wildlands. When Sereden called it a delightful sign, she demanded he show common sense, or face clan censure. The ring sought to mediate between them. Prolonged time spent together merely hardened their positions. 

We cleared fields and held a ceremony in memory of the Barley Goddess and Earth Mother. 

In Imther a strange cube buzzed hostile words into the ears of our explorers. Vorvadrus chose not to interfere with it. 

We raided the Ruby Gates, eluding their patrols. Mor-Kagini came to reinforce our adversaries. Aski sent hunters to attack the newcomers by stealth. They proved too alert to be taken unawares. They fired arrows at our hunters, scattering them. We drove the Ruby Gates from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Ku-Randeri. We were driven from the battlefield and looted. 


Venef 1
The seers said we would have better than usual luck on our raids this year. 

Nyalesta led a caravan to trade with the Oro-Tagini. 

Cannibals and other Chaos foes attacked. Calling on Humakt to guide her sword, Kerenna entered a trance-like state, and danced through the Chaos army, striking to both sides. Finally, the attackers could take no more of this. They broke and ran. 

An Uroxi war band demanded that we scourge ourselves of Chaos by submitting the ring to a scalding wind. We agreed. A bellow shook Berenstead. Hot winds knocked our leaders to the ground, scorching their flesh. Iverlantho and the three oldest ring members suffered the worst of it. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. Realizing that they could not stand against us, the Ku-Randeri fled the field before we closed with them. 

Our foraging trip to the east returned without any food. 

Reda demanded tribute from the Fireflowers. They said they appreciated our verve but saw no reason to pay tribute. Offering us slightly stale kumis, they assured us that they were at least as prepared to fight as we were, if not more so. 

The Genadari stole 78 sheep. 

Devotees of Garavanara, Goddess of Rebirth, wanted us to raid the Varlevings in exchange for 20 horses and 100 cows. We declined. With an insinuating look, their leader said, "You’ll regret this." 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Grey Wings. They were pleased with our generosity. They said that we were their friends, and that we could call on them in the future if we needed to. 

Forosilvuli came to learn a method of fighting the undead from Kerenna, thanking us with a golden gift. We honored Humakt with a sacrifice. The people exulted. 

We were raided by the Trolls. Offir found himself in a position to kill multiple foes. He hewed them left and right, but some escaped. We drove the Trolls off, and their survivors left without looting us. 

Dresta told the ring that Sereden was distracting local spirits. The ring praised his initiative, but told him to stop. People were glad that council let him down gently. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. Poison clouds drifted down to the ground. Vorvadrus sought to summon an air elemental. An air elemental, which said it knew Orlanth when he still lived, appeared to oblige us. It blew the clouds away. He showed his disdain for fire worshipers by roughly buffeting our opponents. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

The Ruby Gate clan wanted help against slave-takers who followed the Chaos god Ompalam. We sent warriors. Our combined force found the Ompalamites, and the battle was joined. The sound thrashing the enslavers received taught them that our valley was not their hunting ground. 

We learned that the Mor-Kagin clan no longer existed, its lands gone. 

Sereden and Iverlantho died of old age. 

We held a funeral for King Iverlantho, sending his ashes to join the sky. The ring sought harmony between royalists and realists. Both sides grumbled during Brekun’s oration.


Venef 2
Our oracles said we would be raided. 

We reorganized the clan ring, making Brekun the new chief. 

Owl spirits warned us we were unready for a great test and must embrace selflessness. We promised the owls we would try. They said they would reward us if we made progress. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for half a season. 

We were raided by the Genadari. Aleen found herself in a position to kill multiple foes. She cut down a good number of them. We drove the Genadari off, and their survivors left without looting us. 

Venef came into his own, as man and prince. He joined the ring as chieftain. We celebrated the dawn of the Venef Era. 

We foraged to the north and found enough food for about a season. 

Nyalesta led a caravan to trade with the Kestangi. 

Nyalesta led a caravan to trade with the Urkarnings. 

Kerenna wanted to initiate four youths as Humakti. This would prevent them from marrying, to our diplomatic detriment. We approved a single initiation. The people were glad that we had followed King Venef’s moderation, taking the middle way. 

Porganosi emissaries sought wergild for the death of their warrior Jorganos, slain by Kerenna. We paid the traditional compensation. Declaring the matter properly concluded, they rode off. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us for 29 cows. 

The Genadari raided us. Vorvadrus found himself in a position to kill multiple foes. He took out many of them. We drove the Genadari off, and their survivors left without plundering our land.


Venef 3
The omens for exploring were good. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Oro-Tagini. 

A vampire slew Serestev. We detailed a party to hunt the vampire. Kerenna came upon the vampire as it fed upon a boar. It turned into smoke. Efforts to find it again proved fruitless. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

We sent a herd raid against the Ku-Randeri, but were spotted. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their herds. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Grey Wings. We drove the Grey Wings off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

We learned that the Ku-Randeri had started a feud with us. 

Dara Happans offered a defensive blessing in exchange for permission to worship with us. We agreed. They said that our fervor for the sun aided them, granting us a more powerful version of the Sun Scope than they expected. 

Nyalesta said we should find a way to find Orlanth and Ernalda still alive, deep in the god’s realm, gaining a boon from them. We instructed our lore keepers to study the sacred stories. The lore speakers embraced Nyalesta’s plan. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Genadari. They offered to parley before the battle. We refused their demand for tribute. We drove the Genadari off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

We were raided by the Ku-Randeri. As the battle started to turn our way, Dresta saw Ku-Rander thieves leaving our citadel with a treasure. She intercepted them. They fled before her might, dropping their prize, Orstan’s Saw. But without Dresta to engage the foe, the main Ku-Rander force cut deeply into our defenders. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

Lore keepers said a ceremonial wedding could help us find Orlanth and Ernalda still alive, deep in the divine realm. The ring said they would deal with this later. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Porganosi.


Venef 4
The seers said we would have better than usual luck on our raids this year. 

Aski’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level. 

Ceaseless rain fell on Berenstead, damaging the crops. We blamed the death of the gods. People were glad we had leaders like Vastyr, who were not afraid to tell the truth, even when it was discouraging. 

Exploring the Dog Hills, Vorvadrus found a Sakkar spirit who said we had earned the right to take it home with us. On the way home, the party was attacked by darkdancers who they managed to evade. 

We sent a herd raid against the Ku-Randeri, but were spotted. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their pastures. 

We slaughtered enough livestock that we could eat for a season. 

We were raided by the Genadari. A Genadari Humakti Death Lord advanced on Vingkara, to engage in single combat. She fought with equal dedication to Death. After an unrelenting clash of blades, our champion fell. Their hero staggered through our ranks, sending five others to their graves. Then her people saw the red stain spreading on her tunic. The Genadari champion collapsed, mortally wounded, the outcome confirming Humakt’s even-handed distribution of doom. We drove the Genadari off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

We heard that the Oro-Tagini planned to annex uninhabited land near their territory. We left them where they were. People could not let go of their fear of an ascendant Oro-Tagin clan. 

People wanted to pursue Nyalesta’s plan to enter the mythic realm. Clan leaders said they had not forgotten. People said they trusted the ring, but expected action. 

Lore keepers said a ceremonial wedding could help us find Orlanth and Ernalda still alive, deep in the divine realm. We sought a Kestangi bride for one of our eligible men. The Kestangi clan said that their pious maiden Sesanne would be willing to enter into a marriage of ceremonial implications. 

Orlanthi of the old Vestantes kingdom came begging to be taken in as refugees. We agreed. Though it would not be easy to feed them, people took pride in this show of generosity. 

The Ku-Randeri stole 18 cows. 

A rift leading to the Other Side was discovered to the north. Explorers sensed the powers of the Man and Mastery runes and the Cow rune. 

Baranwolf was wounded trying to climb a tree to reach a very large nest. 

Aleen died of old age. 

We no longer had the worshipers to support our shrine to Osara.


Venef 5
There were many swirling gusts of wind, but nobody was sure what this meant. 

The Ar-Tarimae reported that Dostal was dead. 

We slaughtered enough livestock that we could eat for half a season. 

Our leading farmers noted that our fields were just beginning to show signs of exhaustion. 

We sent a mission to our allies, the Varleving clan, to ask for food. We asked for two times the usual amount of food. We said we would consider ourselves in debt to the Varlevings for an extra favor. Argiskare, chief of the Varleving clan, agreed to give us the additional food. Many of her farmers seemed sorely affronted by our request. 

A hole in the world opened up, and a glowing Orlanthi devotee and a dragon came through. We helped defeat the monster and were offered a boon. We asked for magic. "This I can grant," the warrior said. Our priests and shamans felt great power surge through them. It was much more than Kerenna had expended. 

Reda asked the Porganosi for their support on a trip into the Gods War. She offered them clan magic. They agreed to help. 

Walking corpses appeared at our gate, as if expecting hospitality. We called on Yinkin, god of cats, to shoo them off. The high hooting cry of the black lynx rang out all around us. The walking corpses stumbled away. Whenever they lost impetus, the cries started up again, luring them away from our lands. 

We found Orlanth’s Comb, a sacred implement from Ernalda’s marriage to Orlanth. 

The marriage of Yorsar and Seleya, from the Genadari clan, was just the latest to fail, but was complicated by her insistence on being repaid her dowry. The Grey Wings agreed to mediate the dispute. Their negotiators were able get the Genadari to agree to a slightly reduced repayment. 

The clan refused to perform the Convert Pastures to Fields venture. 

Nyalesta heard that the Urkarnings, who think little of us, had one of the wedding artifacts we sought. We tried to snatch the treasure from their hall. Nyalesta and company charged into their chieftain’s hall, knocking defenders left and right. We seized the treasure and galloped out of there. It was the Wedding Stead Key. 

Many of our horses were no longer eating, because it gave them pain. We invoked Redalda. The goddess sent fiery stallions to trample the Chaos shards embedded in the bones of our horses. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without looting us. 

Our sworn spirits prepared to depart for their realm, to defend it from Wakboth. Our shamans urged them to go. They replied, "In ways we cannot explain to you, you have armed yourself with the higher weapons needed to save all realms." And thus they departed. 

Loricon and Nyalesta died of old age. 

We found the Wine Drop, a sacred implement from Ernalda’s marriage to Orlanth. 


Venef 6
Our oracles said we would be raided. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

Yinkin worshipers offered to chase away fear. The ring accepted, toasting them in the royal hall. Our mood lightened, and the people looked well upon our leaders. 

We slaughtered enough livestock that we could eat for half a season. 

Our fields had been used for many years, and were no longer as productive. 

The Ku-Randeri ambushed our treasure-searching party in the northeast. Vorvadrus forced the Ku-Randeri to back down. 

We were raided by the Ruby Gates. The Ruby Gate ranks parted, revealing a gargantuan blob of gorp. Reda called on Humakt to fill our swords with death. With the sky blotted out, Reda could not locate the shadow of Humakt’s deathly sword. The creature wreaked havoc on our forces, turning brave fighters to gorp. We drove the Ruby Gates off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

The Genadari raided us. The chief Genadari healer demanded surcease, so that both auxiliaries could heal their warriors. Vastyr said, "Only if you withdraw, giving us goods worth 15 cows." They agreed, giving us what we asked for. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. Hanvan found himself in a position to kill multiple foes. He struck down a good number of them. As the battle ground on, Dresta saw Ku-Rander thieves leaving our citadel with a treasure. She intercepted them. They fled before her might, dropping their prize, the Bone-Chewing Dog. But without Dresta to engage the foe, the main Ku-Rander force cut deeply into our defenders. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without looting us. 

Foragers found disturbing human-like figures, possibly dead, that might have been elves. We asked our spirits to communicate with them. They said these were elves, all right. The living parts of them were miles away, beneath the earth. These dead husks posed no threat and could be left alone. 

Tyram cultists wanted to use our ritual grounds to climb their sky ladder. They said it would increase the might of our sky god worshipers. We called on Urox to protect against them. Our Urox folk stomped and whipped their heads like goring bulls. They reduced the spoor of Chaos, warding us against future outbreaks. 

At the skyfall crater, Vorvadrus found a treasure, the Man Rune. Green fumes issued from the holes they’d dug. One died on the spot and the rest were sickened. 

We cleared fields and held a ceremony in memory of the Barley Goddess and Earth Mother. 

One day, fire stopped working. We invoked Elmal. Elmal sent a bolt through the poison cloud layer to burn the smothering tendrils of Chaos. Immediately afterwards we were able to light fires as normal. 

Dresta led a caravan to trade with the Porganosi. 

Leading herders noted that our pastures were starting to show signs of damage from overgrazing. 

Affronted by words of the king’s friends, Kerenna announced that she would attract the undead to our lands, so she could slay them. Venef toasted her in Beren’s hall. People called this a blatant attempt on Venef’s part to attach himself to Kerenna’s coming feats. 

We found the Bronze String, a sacred implement from Ernalda’s marriage to Orlanth. 

The Genadari raided us. We drove the Genadari off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

Old age carried Vastyr away. 

Our foragers encountered dragonewts who offered food in exchange for knowledge. Baranwolf decided to stay with them. The dragonewts and Baranwolf began walking backwards to the east. As they left, wild grain stalks began sprouting, berries materialized, and what were probably lizard eggs appeared on the ground. We collected enough to feed the clan for over two seasons. 


Venef 7
The outlook for trading was good. 

Our crops failed due to a killing frost. We planted a second crop. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

Devil cultists offered us a prayer to divert an imminent Chaos attack. We treated their offer with the scorn it deserved. As they left, they called out, "Wakboth shall feast on your eyes!" People took heart in our refusal to be cowed. 

Shapestealers and other Chaos foes attacked. Calling on Humakt to guide her sword, Kerenna entered a trance-like state, and rode through the Chaos army, striking to left and right. Finally, the attackers could take no more of this. They hightailed it for home. 

The Urkarning clan brought a legal dispute with the Genadari before the king. Venef held private discussions between the two clans. Unfortunately, the only thing both parties could agree on was that he was a meddling fool. 

Kerenna’s call to the undead brought skeletons to Berenstead. She hewed them down. The ring toasted Kerenna in the royal hall. Offir and Brekun praised her feat with special eloquence. 

Our neighbors the Urkarnings, who had been plagued by these skeletons before Kerenna lured them away, sent sheep and pigs. 

Our foragers were caught by an unseasonable snow storm. 

The Four Drum clan rewarded us for warning them against the influence of Wakboth cultists. We praised their righteous action against Wakboth. They drank in Reda’s eloquent oration. Not to be outdone, they spoke poetically of our foresight and the strong arm we held up against Wakboth and his ilk. 

Dresta led a caravan to trade with the Oro-Tagini. 

We sent a mission to the Porganosi clan to request food in exchange for the favor they owed us. Reda asked for the usual amount. The Porganosi provided us with the food without complaint. 

Genadari farmers brought us grain, at the urging of grain daughter ghosts. We offered goods of equal value. They accepted. 

Dresta led a caravan to trade with the Urkarnings. 

Brekun, seeking a Gods War relic, came upon outlaws rumored to possess such a thing. We attacked. Brekun gave the outlaws a good thumping. The survivors fled. In the abandoned camp we found the Hair Perfume Drop, a divine implement from Ernalda’s marriage to Orlanth. 

Foul weather turned back our trading caravan bound for the Ruby Gate clan. 

A wandering trader offered to exchange goods worth 50 cows for the Bone-Chewing Dog. We said, "Perhaps another year." "I will be back," she said, "unless Chaos gets me." 

Chaos-marked zombies came in response to Kerenna’s call; she slew them. The ring said, "With this second feat you have proven yourself, and need do no more." Kerenna nodded. "Humakt honors the shepherds, who have gone to glorious deaths, but wishes that no more follow them at this time." 

Emissaries of the Varlevings reported that these Chaos zombies had been harrying them. They opened a coffer containing 56 cows worth of gems and necklaces. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us for 21 cows. 

The Porganosi agreed that their young noblewoman Inrana would marry Venef. Inrana’s family said that Venef had shown royal largess.


Venef 8
The oracles said that the gods would judge us by our ability to increase our herds. 

We found the Blue Stick, a sacred implement from Ernalda’s marriage to Orlanth. 

A storm rune in the sky told us we had prepared sufficiently for a journey to the divine realm. We celebrated by feasting the neighbors who had agreed to aid in the rite. They toasted us, saying they looked forward to lending their worship to our rite. 

In preparation for our risky journey into the Gods War, Venef spoke of seeing beyond the obvious. The speech went over people’s heads. Aided by the worship of our supporters we commenced the rite. On a holy steed, its coat dappled grey and gold, Vorvadrus rode to the center of the storm rune we had drawn. Horse and rider ascended into the sky, vanishing into the heavens. 

Vorvadrus plummeted through a thousand shredded stories. He met the biggest wave ever seen, laughing and cruel. Vorvadrus slashed through it not with his sword, but with force of will, and the determination granted by the chanting ritualists back home. The tsunami stopped laughing, for a moment at least. Chaos had been driven back. 

Vorvadrus was there when the Spike blew up, its shattered remnants hurtling toward him. Vorvadrus rode through the debris, sheltered by our clan’s ancient connection to the first horse, Gamari. Stones went to the left and boulders to the right, but Vorvadrus suffered no harm. 

Vorvadrus traveled to the destruction of the glacier that had crushed Nivorah, and saw the solar dome opened to attack by icy Chaos beasts. Vorvadrus hurled himself at the biggest of the ice worms. Catching the titanic creature in just the right spot, he tore open its exposed belly. Great gushes of seething ichor splashed onto the ice, melting it. He felt the hold of Chaos loosen, on the gods’ world, and ours. 

Exhausted, Vorvadrus found the stead of the gods as the wedding of Orlanth and Ernalda began. The deities of the Storm Court asked Vorvadrus for part of our ability to work together. He agreed. Orlanth’s attendants offered our clan a gift. Vorvadrus asked for fertile fields. 

When the ceremony had ended, and the feast afterwards as well, Vorvadrus rode back to the mortal realm. In our parched, stony fields the soil turned rich and dark. Porganosi holy folk knew their fields would be likewise blessed. Vorvadrus had been given the finely made clay jar used to pour his toasts. 

We sent a herd raid against the Ku-Randeri, but were spotted. We were driven off and had no opportunity to gain loot. 

Our pastures had been grazed for many years, and were no longer as productive. 

Elmal commanded the Sky Racers to give us pigs. The ring took credit for this. The people agreed that this was fitting. 

Delegates of the Porganosi clan proposed alliance. We agreed. 

Two people starved to death. 

Hanvan talked to a sturgeon and found an amber drop. He gave it to the sturgeon, who told a story of Beren and Redalda, then swallowed the amber and leaped into the sky. 

Dresta led a caravan to trade with the Porganosi. 

The marriage of Kestald and Sandene, from the Urkarning clan, was just the latest to fail, but was complicated by her insistence on being repaid her dowry. The Porganosi agreed to mediate the dispute. Their negotiators persuaded the Urkarnings to drop Sandene’s demand. 

Uralda’s magic improved our pastures, but couldn’t completely restore their productivity. 

Our horses stopped cooperating. Finally Vorvadrus heard Redalda’s words in a dream. When the horses heard them, they went back to normal. We blamed the Ku-Randeri. "Yes," people said, "interference with horses was exactly the sort of misdeed Ku-Randeri specialize in." We should reply with a raid, they said. 

We sent a mission to the Ar-Tarima clan to request food in exchange for the favor they owed us. Reda asked for the usual amount. The Ar-Tarimae provided us with the food without complaint. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us for 30 cows. 

Uralda’s magic improved our pastures, but couldn’t completely restore their productivity. 

Korestene came into her own as servant of Humakt Death-Dealer. She proposed to kill the Ruby Gate chieftain on her god’s behalf. The clan wished her well. Korestene came back with her sword blooded. She showed the Ruby Gate chief the face of death. Humakt had blessed and increased Korestene’s martial prowess. 

The queen gave birth to a royal heir, naming him Erenlanth. We threw a feast. The babe feasted hungrily on mother’s milk, and we too slaked our thirst. 

We learned that everyone in the Varleving clan had disappeared. 

Reda’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level.


Venef 9
We couldn’t perform Sacred Time rituals to ensure plentiful crops. 

Uralda’s magic restored our pastures. 

Dresta led a caravan to trade with the Ruby Gates. 

Outlaws demanded tribute. We enumerated the folly of their threats. They slunk away, and our people took heart. 

We stole 31 cows from the Ku-Randeri. 

We performed the Decade Rite. We sought protection from herd loss. Elmal granted this. 105 cows appeared immediately in our pastures. 

We were raided by the Grey Wings. We drove the Grey Wings off, and their survivors left without looting our land. 

We foraged to the north and found enough food for about a season. 

Solar priests offered us a golden statue, which they described as a shard of the sun. Instead we offered a lesser amount to have them lead a ceremony featuring the statue. Their rite momentarily filled our ritual grounds with pure sunlight, radiating out from the Golden Man. It palpably enhanced our magic. 

The spirits who left to trick and turn Wakboth in their silver realm returned victorious. 

The Forantin River was no longer tame. We decided to perform the river taming ritual as soon as we could 

We began the "Taming the River" ritual to deal with the wild Forantin River. 

Reda saw a blue dragon raging outside the Golden City. Reda tried to seduce Arcos. But it was Reda who succumbed to the dragon’s blandishments. 

The blue dragon returned to the Golden City, but Reda was there to confront it. Reda tried to use cunning, but was not able to divert the dragon. 

Reda found herself facing a pride of sakkars. As divine beings, the sakkars were willing to bargain. In exchange for her life, Reda had to let the divine sakkars hunt in our land for five years. 

Reda was again blocked by sakkars. Reda sang lullabies, love songs, harvest songs, and finally half-remembered children’s songs. When she tried to leave, the sakkars stood and growled, and she had to sing some more. By the time they let her go, years had passed, and Reda could barely croak. 

The blue dragon returned yet again to the Golden City. Reda commanded the dragon to withdraw. It rebuffed her order. 

Reda returned dejected from the era of the first flood. The Forantin River remained wild. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. Offir found himself able to kill multiple foes. He gave them a good drubbing, but some escaped. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

Dresta convinced the Four Drum clan to create a new trading route. 

Reda’s daughter Rodene came of age, prompting calls for a contest of riding and shooting. We agreed. Any clan that lived nearby came to take part. Rodene rode fast and shot well but was beaten by Endarei of the Fireflower clan. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Ruby Gates. They were pleased with our generosity. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. Korestene saw that the Ku-Randeri had arrayed their archers to deliver a fearsome fusillade. Korestene called on Valind to knock their arrows from the air. As we did not typically seek the aid of Orlanth’s outlaw nephew, Korestene was not surprised when her call went unheard. Their arrows rained down on us, and we suffered greatly. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. 

Old age carried Brekun away. 


Venef 10
The oracles said any children born this year would have great destinies. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

The Porganosi clan wanted to make the Berenethtelli a real kingdom again. We sent delegates to help them sway other clans. The Porganosi discovered that clans who once were loyal to our kings were now reluctant, except in symbolic terms. But they treated us with respect, and gave us gifts. 

Dresta led a caravan to trade with the Grey Wings. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. Kerenna found herself able to kill multiple foes. She cut down many of them. The chief Ku-Rander healer demanded surcease, so that both auxiliaries could heal their warriors. Aski said, "Only if you withdraw, giving us goods worth 15 cows." They agreed, giving us what we asked for. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. Realizing that they could not stand against us, the Ku-Randeri fled the field before we closed with them. 

Dresta led a caravan to trade with the Fireflowers. 

A great elk asked us to stop hunting for two years, promising better hunting for the four years after that. We agreed. Our hunters pledged to uphold the bargain. 

Hoarders took grain from the storehouse. The ring made a show of forgiveness. The people praised the ring’s mercy. "The hoarders grievously erred, but in a way that all of us can feel for." 

We began the "Taming the River" ritual to deal with the wild Forantin River. 

Reda saw a blue dragon raging outside the Golden City. Reda offered to trade with the dragon. She drove a hard and profitable bargain for her wealth. 

Reda found herself facing a pride of sakkars. With desperate sword cuts, she drove them away. 

The blue dragon returned to the Golden City, but Reda was there to confront it. Swinging a blazing sword, she relentlessly drove the dragon before her, forcing it steadily downhill. Finally, Arcos turned and fled, running in the lowest channel it could find. 

The blue dragon returned yet again to the Golden City. Reda commanded the dragon to withdraw. It rebuffed her order. 

Reda returned dejected from the era of the first flood. The Forantin River was still untamed. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without looting us. 


Venef 11
The oracles said we should explore distant lands this year. 

Korestene’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level. 

Past the northern mountains, Kerenna encountered Ergeshites, who offered a gift of dried goat meat. Kerenna said, "All we seek is unity." "It is sad to be the object of distrust," said the lion priest. Kerenna hid her disappointment as the explorers departed. A few hours later, a vision of Chalana Arroy appeared, bathing them in soothing light. "The Lion Folk took the wrong meaning from your healing words," she said. "But I understood." 

Chalana Arroy promised that exploration would help heal the world. The goddess gave us the Honest Ash Pot, describing its abilities. 

Internal dissension arose over the missing regalia, and whether we should try harder to find it. Council said, "Let’s cool our heads before speaking any further." Leaders of each faction agreed that heated words solved nothing. We would come back to this later, in a spirit of sober reflection. 

Vorvadrus and his party never returned from an expedition to the southwest. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the field with a withering barrage of arrows. Our bowstrings sang, thanks to Dostal. 

Ogres and other Chaos foes attacked. Calling on Humakt to guide her sword, Kerenna entered a trance-like state, and rode through the Chaos army, striking to left and right. Finally, the attackers could take no more of this. They broke and ran. 

Royal attendants discovered a grate in the cellar of our citadel. Someone or something had come up through it and taken one of our treasures, Orlanth’s Comb. We sought the aid of spirits. Owl spirits said that the robbers were dwarves. "Your ancestors enslaved them, forcing them to build this place," they hooted. "They built this grate so they could come back at any time and exact a toll for the crimes of Beren!" We replaced the grate, blocking it with heavy items. People reckoned that this would solve the problem. 

Our explorers are back. They found a ruined house containing what they hoped would be the Mantle of Redalda. Inside they instead found an unrelated treasure, the Groom’s Belt. 

We sent Rodene with gifts to the Genadari. 

To show us up, the Jade Colts proposed a sweep against Chaos. We sent Rodene to ask valley clans to instead support Berenstead’s campaign against Chaos. Rodene showed that Beren’s fight against Wakboth gave us the knowledge to lead a fight against Chaos that the upstart Jade Colts lacked. Our would-be rivals pretended they were happy to turn the leadership of the sweep over to us. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the High Stallions. They said that we were their friends, and that we could call on them in the future if we needed to. 

We were raided by the Ku-Randeri. Korestene found herself able to kill multiple foes. She took out a good number of them. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

We asked the High Stallions to offer a gift on our behalf to the Ku-Rander clan. The Ku-Randeri refused to accept it, let alone end their feud. 

Devotees of Sothearith, Goddess of Rebirth, wanted us to raid the Porganosi in exchange for 22 horses and 110 cows. We declined. With an insinuating look, their leader said, "You’ll regret this."


Venef 12
The oracles predicted good calving. 

In Infithan, Kerenna’s explorers saw a zombie mammoth smashing a house with people inside. Kerenna attacked. They hacked away at the mammoth’s rotting flesh until it collapsed. It fell on one of the explorers, crushing him utterly. The beast’s rider speared one of us in the leg, but not fatally. We then made short work of it. The Infithtelli inside the house told us that the undead would soon outnumber the living. "Berenethtelli needn’t risk themselves for Infithtelli, but you did so," they said, giving us a gift. "Take this for safekeeping. When this is over, perhaps a future king might reclaim it for our people." Unfurling a protective cloth, they passed us the Tusk of Infithan, which would aid us in combat when we fought outside our valley. 

Our crops failed due to a killing frost. We planted a second crop. 

Outlander Wheels offered to perform magic of Ompalam, greatly increasing our treasury, in exchange for ten people to be taken as slaves. They also wanted us to fly their banner. We declined. They said they would leave the temptation with us, like a seed. It would grow inside us, and one day they would be back to reap it. We then called on Urox. Our bull grunters stomped and huffed. They said that Storm Bull had brutally gored the forces of Chaos. It would be harder for them to act against us. 

A glow leading to the Gods War was discovered to the northeast. Explorers sensed the powers of the Beast rune and the Bull rune. 

With passions cooled, we revisited the question of a regalia hunt. Council said, "We must set aside traditions that no longer serve us." The regalia seekers found solace in an older tradition, that of Hyalor the Rider, who taught our solar ancestors to change the rules and survive. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. Poison clouds drifted down to the ground. Rodene called on Urox the Searing Wind. Urox had bigger worries than stupid clouds, and left us to handle the problem on our own. Rodene commanded that we should use the fog as cover. Though it burned our lungs and reddened our eyes, we befriended the fog, using it as a curtain to attack from. By the time it dispersed, we had taken out many of the toughest foes. We drove the Ku-Randeri from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

A wandering trader offered to exchange goods worth 50 cows for the Bone-Chewing Dog. We said, "Perhaps another year." "I will be back," she said, "unless Chaos gets me." 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. Realizing that they could not stand against us, the Ku-Randeri fled the field before we closed with them. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Genadari. We drove the Genadari off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

Zombies attacked a patrol. We scoured the borderlands for remaining zombies. Kerenna found that we had already disposed of all the zombies in our territory. This calmed jarred nerves. 

We began the "Taming the River" ritual to deal with the wild Forantin River. 

Reda saw a blue dragon raging outside the Golden City. Reda offered to trade with the dragon. She drove a hard and profitable bargain for her wealth. 

Reda found herself facing a pride of sakkars. With desperate sword cuts, she drove them away. 

The blue dragon returned to the Golden City, but Reda was there to confront it. Reda tried to use cunning, but was not able to divert the dragon. 

The blue dragon returned yet again to the Golden City. Swinging a blazing sword, she relentlessly drove the dragon before her, forcing it steadily downhill. Finally, Arcos turned and fled, running in the lowest channel it could find. 

Reda returned dejected from the era of the first flood. The Forantin River was still untamed. 

Kerenna entered the Gods War, finding a fork leading to two divine beings. She followed a line of snares to find Dostal the hunter. 

The hunting god asked how we had strayed from the lessons he taught us. Kerenna said, "Point me to another elk and I’ll prove my worth." Dostal replied, "Bring me the Wiliest Elk." Kerenna sought the elk in meadow and marsh, finally finding it behind the First Tree. She sent an arrow into its heart, and felt Dostal’s hand on her shoulder. "That was good. But next you must find me again." And the God of Snares was gone. 

Regaining their senses in the tent of Seseine, the questers realized that they had promised to name a clan whose head she should take. Kerenna said, "You are not a woman. You are men’s fear of women." The incense soured. Seseine lost her luster and became an unreal thing. Kerenna commanded her questers to depart, and no one stood in their way. 

The questers entered the Sun Path, where Yonesh the Cold Sun blasted frigid energy at them. They responded with Elmal’s fire. Fire infused the questers’ shields and the blades of their swords. When they struck at the Cold Sun, he reared back and wept. "I thought true flame had gone from this world," he said. 

The questers met Samnal, who told them we should chain our horses to chariots. The questers attacked. Taken by surprise, the thin-boned Wheel god leapt for his chariot. With a fury born in the ancient days of Nivorah, we bashed the cart deity left and right. 

Kerenna’s questers found Dostal, who asked what gift they desired. Kerenna said, "Fill our wildlands with game." "Never be afraid to take the obvious choice," the god smiled. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without looting us. 

Our solar worshipers said we should go back to being Riders. The ring said it would grant their request due consideration. They thanked council for hearing them out. 

Dresta could not persuade the Ar-Tarimae to create a new trading route.


Venef 13
The oracles expected that our esteem among the other clans would increase. 

Korstardos’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level. 

Forosilvuli ghosts asked our explorers to avenge them against skeletons. We destroyed a legion of them. The ghosts showed us where to dig up a treasure. It was the Snake Staff. 

Hanvan wanted the ring to sanction Kerenna for killing an outlander hunter. They admonished her. Kerenna bore council’s words stoically. The people took pride in the ring’s stance. "Who are we if we lose our mercy?" 

We abandoned our herd raid against the Ruby Gates because they spotted us. 

Krarsht ate the Cow Mother. We called on the devoured goddess for one last blessing. As she fell into the mouth of Chaos, Uralda ensured that cows would survive a while longer--not in the wider world, but in Berenstead and perhaps the valley. 

Dresta led a caravan to trade with the Chov-Ashdae. 

We sent Reda with gifts to the Urkarnings. They said that we were their friends, and that we could call on them in the future if we needed to. 

Offir threw the emblems and saw auspicious signs for a solar rite. We performed it. Our solar followers felt bright power rush through them. Light filled our Elmal shrine. 

We began the "Taming the River" ritual to deal with the wild Forantin River. 

Offir saw a blue dragon raging outside the Golden City. Offir offered to trade with the dragon. Infatuated with the dragon, Offir agreed to accept a handful of pearls in exchange for his wealth. 

The blue dragon returned to the Golden City, but Offir was there to confront it. Swinging a blazing sword, he relentlessly drove the dragon before him, forcing it steadily downhill. Finally, Arcos turned and fled, running in the lowest channel it could find. 

Offir found himself facing a pride of sakkars. With desperate sword cuts, he drove them away. 

The blue dragon returned yet again to the Golden City. Offir tried to use cunning, but was not able to divert the dragon. 

Offir returned dejected from the era of the first flood. The Forantin River was still untamed. 

We heard that the Genadari planned to annex uninhabited land near their territory. We told them to leave it alone, or else. They agreed with Reda that they had insufficient workers, and would stretch themselves too thin if they annexed the abandoned stead. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Ku-Randeri. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

Farnan Quick-Sword of the Porganosi clan asked us to help raid the Urkarnings. Our warriors took part in a dangerous fight. Farnan Quick-Sword praised them, and sent them home with a share of the loot. 

We learned that everyone in the Fireflower clan had disappeared. 

Old age carried Kerenna away. 

Dresta convinced the Deleskaring clan to create a new trading route. 

Hanvan’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level.


Venef 14
The oracles said that the gods would judge us by our ability to increase our herds. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

A Star Captain told us we would soon be visited by Storm People with a ragged tiger, and that he would reward us if we convinced them to pay homage to the sun. The ring said, "Let us worship Elmal together." Our place of solar worship pulsed with the Loyal Guardian’s light. We gained magic, and the Star Captain glowed with greater intensity. 

Dwarves again came up the grate to steal from us, this time taking the Honest Ash Pot. The shaft could only be entered in a perpendicular position, feet first, legs dangling below. Aski wriggled his way a few feet down, then cried out in shock and agony. We pulled him out, to find a metal, bladed contraption slicing deep into the flesh of his ankle. Clearly we would be unable to take our fight to the dwarves. 

We raided the Forosilvuli. An Orlanthi champion flew up from the Forosilvuli ranks, but fell to earth, unable to draw breath. Offir finished him. Fear rippled through the Forosilvuli ranks. We were driven off and had no opportunity to pillage. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us. Offir spotted a vampire feeding on Dresta. Offir attacked with grim resolve. Fearing Offir’s lack of fear, the vampire stood transfixed. Offir lopped his head off. Seeing their champion fall to the ground, the Ku-Randeri lost impetus. Star Dancer swords laid them low. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without looting our land. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. A fissure opened up, disgorging Chaos creatures, who attacked Star Dancers and Ku-Randeri alike. Offir signaled the Ku-Rander war leader to unite against them. He signaled agreement. We turned as one on the Chaos horde. Both of us lost warriors, but the legions of Wakboth suffered more, and were wiped out. 

We were raided by the Ruby Gates. We broke open a whirlwind jar, putting 23 Ruby Gates out of action. We drove the Ruby Gates off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

Ceaseless rain fell on Berenstead, damaging the crops. We blamed the death of the gods. The people nodded. "This is what Rodene has been saying all along. Why is she not on the ring?" 

A rain of Chaos worms fell on us, draining our sworn spirits. Through our drummers we sent healing magic to our spirits. 

Reda and her party never returned from exploring to the northeast. 

The Forosilvuli raided us. We drove the Forosilvuli off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

Shepherds spotted intruders before they could steal our lambs. We sent a party to find the trespassers. Aski found them hunkered down in a gully, keening in a strange tongue, airing out the tentacles they kept hidden beneath their cloaks. They were still scrambling for their weapons when we attacked. We finished them quickly, before they could rally. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

We were raided by the Ku-Randeri. Korstardos found himself in a position to kill multiple foes. He took out a good number of them. An Elmali warrior came toward Denda, bearing radiant shield and sword. Denda thought, "I shall dim his light with fury." Denda crashed headlong into the enemy’s glowing shield, knocking him to the ground, where he lay wounded. Like a true berserk, Denda finished him. The Ku-Randeri fell into disorder. We sent more of them to escort the Elmali champion to the realm of the dead. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without looting our land. 

Old age carried Dresta away. 


Venef 15
The omens were contradictory. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

The Sky Racers called in a favor, asking for 17 cows. We gave them what they asked for. 

We stole 34 cows from the Ruby Gates. 

Forosilvuli traders visited; these were the people Star Captain Arzfanits hoped would pay homage to the sun. We said, "If you pay homage to the sun, we will gift you." "In these dying days, wealth is life," their emissary said. "What harm can a sunburn do?" They took part in our solar ceremony, then departed with our gift. 

Dresta’s daughter Doresa said she had inherited her mother’s powers. She requested permission to present herself to area spirits. We said she would have to convince our shamans. They held to their position; if she had Dresta’s powers at all, she was not yet ready to wield them. 

We raided the Ku-Randeri, eluding their patrols. Realizing that they could not defend against us, the Ku-Randeri fled the field before we closed with them. 

The Grey Wings used Pelakara the Trader to send us a gift. The ring toasted Pelakara in the clan hall. Our mood lightened, and the people looked well upon our leaders. 

We foraged to the north and found enough food for about two seasons. 

Illness swept through the clan. We invoked Chalana Arroy. Our healers could not pierce the din of prayers to reach the goddess. 

The Star Captain came to offer the promised boon for bringing the sun to Forosan. Forgotten lore flooded Doresa’s mind. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

As reprisal for our many attacks against them, the Ku-Rander clan struck a deal with a vampire, which slew Denda. We sued the Ku-Randeri for peace. They said that this was all they had ever wanted, and that the misunderstanding that had driven us into wasteful conflict must now be forgotten. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

We were raided by the Kestangi. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

Monstrous animals damaged the hillfort. Hanvan and his hunters killed a couple of the beasts. The others charged us, sending warriors flying from horseback. When the monsters had their fill of vengeance, they stomped away. We feasted that night, and cured and salted the rest of the meat.


Venef 16
Trading wasn’t expected to be as profitable this year. 

Our crops failed due to Chaos worms. We planted a second crop. 

We realized we had forgotten a song that everyone knew. We sent Doresa to the Grey Wings. 

Doresa asked the Grey Wings about the lost song. They professed not to know what Doresa was talking about. 

Booming sounds and flashing lights swept through the valley. "What was that?" the people asked. The ring could not say what it was. The people nodded. Sometimes you didn’t know what a bad omen foretold until its prediction came true. 

Our raiding party had to spend clan magic to cross the Forantin River. We raided the Kestangi. We drove the Kestangi from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

Doresa led a caravan to trade with the Genadari. 

The farmer Gordangar killed his brother Jarolor, later saying he had been possessed by Chaos. We called on Urox to scourge Chaos from him. Hot winds buffeted and scalded Gordangar, burning out the Chaos. The ring declared him innocent. Members of the dominant royalist faction praised the ring for following the truth. Their opponents said that the ring had put politics above justice and wisdom. Yes, he had been scourged of Chaos, they said, but surely the rest of the family should not have to look at Jarolor’s murderer every day. 

Weeders came to trade dried fish. We accepted, encouraging people to take heart in their survival. People found inspiration in the continuance of the famously put-upon Weeders. 

The Ku-Randeri ambushed our exploration party in the north. Korestene forced the Ku-Randeri to back down. 

We were unable to conduct a raid against the Kestangi due to a winter storm. 

Our raiding party had to spend clan magic to cross the Forantin River. We raided the Kestangi, eluding their patrols. We drove the Kestangi from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

Old age carried Enerin away. 

In the gnarled wood of Aryela, Korestene met raccoon folk who gave us a box with a treasure, the Ewe Totem, inside. 


Venef 17
We couldn’t perform Sacred Time rituals to ensure plentiful crops. 

We began the "Taming the River" ritual to deal with the wild Forantin River. 

Offir saw a blue dragon raging outside the Golden City. Offir tried to seduce Arcos. But it was Offir who succumbed to the dragon’s blandishments. 

The blue dragon returned to the Golden City, but Offir was there to confront it. Offir offered to trade with the dragon. He drove a hard and profitable bargain for his wealth. 

Offir found himself facing a pride of sakkars. He attacked. There were too many of them. Offir was nearly disemboweled by a claw, and finally fled. 

Offir was again blocked by sakkars. As divine beings, the sakkars were willing to bargain. In exchange for his life, Offir let the sakkars hunt in our land for five seasons. 

The blue dragon returned yet again to the Golden City. Swinging a blazing sword, he relentlessly drove the dragon before him, forcing it steadily downhill. Finally, Arcos turned and fled, running in the lowest channel it could find. 

Offir returned dejected from the era of the first flood. The Forantin River remained wild. 

Our raiders were slowed only briefly by crossing the Forantin River. We raided the Kestangi. We drove the Kestangi from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

The Andayling clan no longer brought the tribute we once extracted from them. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Kestangi. They offered to parley before the battle. We exchanged taunts. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

Forosilvuli wanderers begged to be taken in as refugees. We agreed. Lore-keepers reminded all of our enmity with the Forosilvuli. There was no escaping history, they said. 

While exploring to the north, Korestene discovered a herd of golden mares: Redalda’s first herd. Korestene asked to learn the song to sing to the herd. The lead mare agreed. 

We sent a peace delegation to the Ku-Randeri. After a long and sometimes tense negotiation, they agreed to end the feud. 

Some of our hunters went missing, returning a week later as walking corpses. We told them that they were dead and had to leave the valley. They nodded sadly and shuffled away. Though still horrified, people saw that this was as good a resolution as we could hope for. 

Rodene asked the Ku-Randeri about the lost song. They professed not to know what Rodene was talking about. 

Enjossi volunteered to perform a blessing that would draw game to us from neighboring steads. The ring said, "If this was Dostal magic we might be tempted." We agreed to let Hanvan attempt the rite. Hanvan sent out his hunters, who found their traps full of game, including animals we thought had died out. 

Leika convinced the Ku-Rander clan to create a new trading route. 

Yinkin worshipers offered us a blessing against rats. We agreed, inviting them to feast with us. Phantom cats bolstered the efforts of our own alynxes. At the feast, Yinkin folk performed acrobatic feats and contested with our hunters in feats of dexterity. An unexpected feeling settled upon the people. After a while, they realized it was joy. 

Marele died of old age. 

Rodene asked the Four Drums about the lost song. They were able to give us a hint.


Venef 18
The omens were contradictory. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

Royal attendants found a strange, humming device in the cellar chamber, left by dwarves. We sought the aid of spirits. Spirit squirrels rippled from the wildlands, into our citadel, and down the stairs to the cellar chamber. They entered the device, stuffing its innards with spectral leaves and ghostly pine cones. The humming stopped; the spirits had clogged up the device, rendering it inoperable. 

Our raiding party had to spend clan magic to cross the Forantin River. We raided the Kestangi. We drove the Kestangi from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

We were raided by the Kestangi. Minaryth found himself in a position to kill many of the foe. He cut down a good number of them. Offir saw that the Kestangi had arrayed their missile force to deliver a fearsome fusillade. Offir called on Valind to knock their javelins from the air. Valind answered Offir’s plea. When the Kestangi fired, an icy blast diverted the javelins. Surprised, they fell into disarray. We pressed our advantage. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us for 22 cows. 

Minaryth agitated against the Ku-Randeri, winning support among the people. The ring said, "Minaryth maligns the Ku-Randeri." People agreed that Minaryth had unfairly described their supposed offenses against us. 

The Four Drum clan wanted help against slave-takers who followed the Chaos god Ompalam. We gifted them with magic. They found the Ompalamites and, thanks in part to the strength we lent their swords, soundly defeated them. Grateful for the chance to recover their captives, they sent us gifts worth 10 cows. 

We sent Rodene with gifts to the Grey Wings. They said that we were their friends, and that we could call on them in the future if we needed to. 

Devil cultists offered us a prayer to divert an imminent Chaos attack. We treated their offer with the scorn it deserved. As they left, they called out, "Wakboth shall feast on your marrow!" People took heart in our refusal to be cowed. 

Shapestealers and other Chaos foes attacked. Calling on Humakt to guide her sword, Korestene entered a trance-like state, and rode through the Chaos army, striking to both sides. Finally, the attackers could take no more of this. They hightailed it for home. 

We were raided by the Ku-Randeri. Korestene spotted a vampire feeding on Hanvan. Korestene attacked with grim resolve. Fearing Korestene’s connection to the honor of Death, the vampire stood transfixed. Korestene lopped his head off. Seeing their champion fall to the ground, the Ku-Randeri lost impetus. Star Dancer swords laid them low. We drove the Ku-Randeri off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

Rodene asked the High Stallions about the lost song. They were able to give us a clue. 

Leika convinced the Porganosi clan to create a new trading route.


Venef 19
The oracles said that if we sent no more than a dozen warriors, our first herd raid this year would be extraordinarily successful. 

Iverlantho manifested as a ghost to offer us a boon. We asked him to bless our rites. "I will grant you this boon," said the king’s ghost. 

We stole 33 cows from the Genadari. 

We performed the Decade Rite. We sought protection from loss of respect. Elmal granted this. 

A doorway leading to the Other Side was discovered to the north. Explorers sensed the powers of the Horse rune and the Harmony rune. 

We raided the Ruby Gates, eluding their patrols. Realizing that they could not defend against us, the Ruby Gates fled the field before we closed with them. 

A statue of the Chaos god Ragnaglar appeared overnight in our pasture land. We called on Urox. A hot wind came from the south to encircle the statue. It turned to sand and blew away. 

Jajalarings asked for help freeing captives from the Ruby Gates. Rodene paid the ransom on their behalf. The Ruby Gate chief spoke in admiration of our mercy. "We saw the Dog Folk only as a way of earning advantage, but you saw them as people." They decreased the ransom, by 10 cows worth. "That was the outlander price," they said. The Jajalarings went to the wild part of our lands to perform their rite, which we were not permitted to witness. Korestene said it had decreased the strength and prevalence of undead activity. 

We began the "Taming the River" ritual to deal with the wild Forantin River. 

Leika saw a blue dragon raging outside the Golden City. Leika offered to trade with the dragon. She drove a hard and profitable bargain for her treasure. 

Leika found herself facing a pride of sakkars. Leika sang lullabies, love songs, harvest songs, and finally half-remembered children’s songs. When she tried to leave, the sakkars stood and growled, and she had to sing some more. By the time they let her go, years had passed. 

Leika was again blocked by sakkars. As divine beings, the sakkars were willing to bargain. In exchange for her life, Leika let the sakkars hunt in our land for four seasons. 

The blue dragon returned to the Golden City, but Leika was there to confront it. Leika tried to seduce Arcos. But it was Leika who succumbed to the dragon’s blandishments. 

The blue dragon returned yet again to the Golden City. Leika commanded the dragon to withdraw. Fearful of the power of the celestial gods, it agreed to flow peacefully. 

Leika returned dejected from the era of the first flood. The Forantin River was still untamed. 

The Ku-Randeri stole 24 cows. 

Our Ernalda priestesses discovered that her grain vessels were contaminated. We sought the aid of spirits. Spirits sucked the corruption from the grain and feasted upon it. They could not restore the ruined vessels, but at least had stopped future losses.


Venef 20
We couldn’t perform Sacred Time rituals to help with diplomacy. 

Korestene entered the Gods War, finding a fork leading to two divine beings. The sound of hoofbeats led to Redalda, first queen of Berenstead. 

Korestene found a divine reflection of ancient Berenstead. She sought to help Redalda bring harmony to our Storm and Sky factions. Korestene addressed them, saying, "Berenstead becomes a beacon to the valley--if you let it." "You can’t be our descendants," the contending nobles cried. "Such scrawny and starveling folk--what great destiny is that?" Redalda stepped in to calm them, but Korestene could not hear her, as a malign force pulled her journeyers deeper into the realm of mysteries. 

Drawn to the upper dome of the Gods Realm, the questers saw Tyram the Sky Horror poisoning the Celestial River. They attacked with implacable certitude. Our swords sang straight and true, biting into the Sky Horror and sending him tumbling from the dome. Starry deities, kin of Elmal, gifted us with light, which would aid Korestene on the next stage of her journey. 

The questers encountered Aroka the Blue Water Dragon, who had taken the rain hostage. Korestene sought to stab him, as Humakt would. The power of death met the might of the sea. Even the liquidity of water could not withstand the Sword of Truth. Korestene slew the dragon, freeing Heler from his bonds. 

Korestene saw all the Chaos gods massing for battle. One of them, Teghern, lunged for her. Korestene met his charge. Embodying Elmal, Korestene buffeted the dread god with her shield, sending it tumbling head over heels. 

The questers made their way back to Redalda, who offered a boon. Korestene said, "I seek to improve my skill in diplomacy." Redalda approved of this choice. "When Issaries the Talking God died, I did my best to preserve his ways. The more who master them, the more likely they are to survive this age of destruction." 

Rodene asked the Sky Racers about the lost song. They professed not to know what Rodene was talking about. 

Devotees of Rachna, Goddess of Harmony, wanted us to raid the Porganosi in exchange for 24 horses and 120 cows. We agreed. They said the gift would come in a year, if we had performed the task Rachna had assigned us. 

We began the "Taming the River" ritual to deal with the wild Forantin River. 

Korestene saw a blue dragon raging outside the Golden City. Swinging a blazing sword, she relentlessly drove the dragon before her, forcing it steadily downhill. Finally, Arcos turned and fled, running in the lowest channel it could find. 

The blue dragon returned to the Golden City, but Korestene was there to confront it. Korestene commanded the dragon to withdraw. Fearful of the power of the celestial gods, it agreed to flow peacefully. 

Korestene found herself facing a pride of sakkars. With deft sword strokes, she drove them away. 

The blue dragon returned yet again to the Golden City. Korestene tried to use cunning, but was not able to divert the dragon. 

Reladivus thanked Korestene for putting the Arcos back in its place, and granted us mastery over the Forantin River. 

Goats invaded our pastures, as part of a magical attack on Storm Bull. We could help thwart this by denouncing goats to those who herded them. We sent Korestene to the so-called Zarkosites. 

We raided the Porganosi, eluding their patrols. They informed us that our alliance was no more. The chief Porganosi healer demanded surcease, so that both auxiliaries could heal their warriors. Leika said, "Only if you surrender, giving us goods worth 15 cows." They agreed, giving us what we asked for. 

The Grey Wings raided us. Hanvan found himself able to kill multiple foes. He struck down a good number of them. We drove the Grey Wings off, and their survivors left without looting our land. 

Two people died from starvation. 

The eye of Wakboth filled the sky. The ring warned the people that the time of crisis would be long. Though the Eye bore into our souls and haunted our dreams, it could not take from us the passion for survival gifted to us by Hyalor and honed by Beren. We would outwait Wakboth, and endure. 

The Zarkosites listened implacably as Korestene recounted how Ragnaglar had corrupted all goats. The Zarkosites permitted her to leave. 

Our foraging trip to the northwest returned without any food. 

Striking a deal with foreign priestesses, the High Stallions received 100 cows for attacking their allies, the Oro-Tagini. We sent Rodene to the Oro-Tagini to propose an alliance. They said stout allies were needed more than ever. The Oro-Tagin god-talkers had identified the priestesses as worshipers of Seseine, Chaos goddess of temptation. Together we would fight her, and all of her ilk. 

We sent a mission to our allies, the High Stallion clan, to ask for food. We asked for two times the usual amount of food. We said we would consider ourselves in debt to the High Stallions for an extra favor. Alakorde, chief of the High Stallion clan, agreed to give us the additional food. Many of his farmers seemed sorely affronted by our request. 

Leading herders noted that our pastures were just beginning to show signs of damage from overgrazing. 

The Forosilvuli raided us. They offered to parley before the battle. They asked for tribute, and we paid a lesser amount. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us for 25 cows. 

When a shaft of sunlight shone upon our citadel, Sky Racers came to call it a sign of Yelm’s resurrection. We told them we did not share their certitude. They departed without rancor, saying that if they were right, the whole world would soon know. 

We were raided by the Kestangi. Jade Colts came to reinforce our adversaries. Korestene sent hunters to attack the newcomers by stealth. They proved too alert to be taken unawares. They fired arrows at our hunters, scattering them. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

We learned that everyone in the Chov-Ashda clan had disappeared. 

We no longer had the worshipers to support our shrine to our ancestors. 

We sent Leika to the Oro-Tagini to try to trade treasures with them. She was unable to buy the Borrowed Tongue.


Venef 21
The omens implied a good year for our hunters. 

We slaughtered enough livestock that we could eat for half a season. 

Ogres and other Chaos foes attacked. Doresa summoned wolf spirits, and sent them to nip at the ogres. Finally our resistance was too much for them, and they pulled back. Afterwards, we discovered that the Chaos horde had damaged our foraging grounds. 

Sky Racers sought aid building a temple to Yelm, who they said had returned to the sky. We sent token support. They expressed their satisfaction. Perhaps they expected more, but what we gave did not offend them. 

Leika led a caravan to trade with the Sky Racers. 

We raided the Kestangi. The chief Kestangi healer demanded surcease, so that both auxiliaries could heal their warriors. Aski said, "Only if you surrender, giving us goods worth 15 cows." They agreed, giving us what we asked for. 

A mission from the Genadari clan demands compensation for our use of a blessing to draw game from their lands. We said, "We don’t know what you’re talking about." They crossed their arms. "You cannot lie to us. We performed a divination." We said, "For this impudence, you must die." We saw them wither as Korestene described how hungry they would be after we looted their storehouses. "We withdraw our complaint," they said. "The hated Porganosi must surely have Eurmaled our divination rite." 

Rodene didn’t hold back in condemning goats to the Jade Colts. The Jade Colts listened to her in growing fury, before shouting her down. Jade Colt Swords escorted our delegation out of their land, but the ritual message had been delivered. 

Outlaws threatened our foraging party in the south. Hanvan and his forces killed and scattered them. 

Balurgans wanted us to help them capture a Genadari, to trade for their young god-talker held hostage. We declined. 

Our foraging trip to the land where the Varlevings once lived did not go well. 

Foul weather turned back our trading caravan bound for the Sky Racer clan. 

The Trolls raided us. The troll leader, a flame-wreathed Death Lord, advanced on Leika. Leika advanced, matching our Death rune mastery against his. The Death Lord sheared through Leika’s armor, cutting her nearly in two. We reeled in shock. The trolls pressed us back. We drove the Trolls off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us for 32 cows. 

The Kestangi stole 18 cows.


Venef 22
The oracles identified no omens, and this troubled them. 

We sent Doresa to the Sky Racers to try to trade treasures with them. She traded the Golden Mare for their Tide-Turning Spear. 

We learned that the Urkarnings had put their undead relatives to work tilling their fields. We sent emissaries to demand they destroy their undead. Rodene convinced them that the cost of consorting with the undead would easily outweigh the advantages. They destroyed them, aided by Yinkin, god of cats. 

We foraged to the north and found enough food for about a season. 

We raided the Forosilvuli, eluding their patrols. Aski found himself in a position to kill many of the foe. He cut down many of them. A Storm Bull champion charged at Aski. He fought with hunter’s guile. Aski ducked and weaved, but their champion bulled his way through to finally land a resounding blow. Aski fell prone and could neither move nor speak. We drove the Forosilvuli from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

The consecration of the Sky Racer clan Yelm temple led to disaster. A Chaos sun filled the sky. Many of our attendees died or were wounded. Leaders said, "This went awry, but we must still seek new answers." People agreed. "Sky Racers may be fools, but that does not mean all departures from tradition were bad." 

The Ruby Gates raided us. We drove the Ruby Gates off, and their survivors left without looting us. 

The dread deity Teghern appeared at Berenstead to gloat, revealing himself as the true form of the Chaos Sun. We said, "We see through you, Teller of Lies." The trunked god wrinkled his noses. "Why? What is it you see? There is nothing to see, but--" He stopped himself short, then turned into a green cloud and wafted away. 

Rodene asked the Urkarnings about the lost song. They professed not to know what Rodene was talking about. 

Rodene asked the Genadari about the lost song. They professed not to know what Rodene was talking about. 

The Eater of Skin attacked Berenstead. We sent Korestene to fight it. Replicating the battle from the Gods War, Korestene evaded a stomp from each of its first four feet, then deliberately stood beneath the monster’s fifth tread. Her upthrust spear pierced its foot, sending it yowling back to the Gods War. Korestene was only partially crushed and would eventually recover. 

The Ku-Randeri raided us for 23 cows. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Kestangi. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without looting us.


Venef 23
We couldn’t improve our success in other rituals with Sacred Time rituals. 

The Genadari clan gave ten of their people to Ompalam cultists. We sent a party to find and slay the slave-takers. Korestene found them by following the sound of creaking axles. She outmaneuvered them, toppling their chariots on top of them. Their outraged captives strangled the Ompalamites with their own chains. One of our warriors sustained wounds. 

We raided the Kestangi, eluding their patrols. We drove the Kestangi from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

The High Stallion clan began to succumb to Chaos influence. We offered to aid them in a purifying rite. They fell to their knees and begged for our assistance. "We thought we could compromise just a little, and survive," they said. Together we performed the rite. Urox came to blow away the miasma of Chaos. Chalana Arroy cleansed the wounds in their land and souls. They promised never again to be tempted by the blandishments of Wakboth. 

The time of the expected attack by the Author of Sores drew nearer. We asked the Grey Wings to send fighters. They said they would send some of their best fighters, choosing in particular devotees of Elmal and Osara. 

Tyram cultists wanted to use our ritual grounds to climb their sky ladder. They said it would increase the might of our sky and earth worshipers. Instead, we sent Aski out to look for roving Uroxi. He found an Uroxi band led by Thudkhan the Bellower. They found and slew the Tyramites, then said we must pay to support them for a while. 

The Author of Sores attacked, as predicted. A joint force went out to fight her. With unearthly speed the Author of Sores reached down to pluck up her adversaries, pulling them apart with her great scarred hands. She killed two of us. As many Grey Wings suffered the same fate. But their sacrifice was not in vain. Korestene commanded the force to attack with precision, causing the monster to lose her balance. This gave each sword a target. Together we slashed at the Author of Sores until she lost substance and melted away. 

Doresa led a caravan to trade with the Urkarnings. 

Rodene demanded annual tribute from the Ku-Randeri. They agreed that we deserved the tribute we requested. Coming home from the Ku-Randeri, Rodene was attacked, but returned home with her escort. 

A Nontraya priest came for our Ernalda devotee, Uraldinna. We said, "Take one more step and we’ll tear you to pieces." His laughter soured the milk of our cows. We attacked. Aski fought the Chaos priest and his terrible wolf. The beast bit him, but Aski laid the Nontraya worshiper low. The talokans, who had been fighting our warriors, loped away at speed. The skirmish left four of our warriors hurt. 

Uraldinna proposed organizing other clans to strike back at Nontraya the Taker. Our sages said that Nontraya hated Ernalda after she spurned his love for her. We could get other clans to help in a ritual, and ambush Nontraya’s minions. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for a season. 

Doresa led a caravan to trade with the Urkarnings. 

We were raided by the Forosilvuli. A Forosilvuli Humakti Death Lord advanced on Minaryth, to engage in single combat. He braced for battle with Elmal’s light. Minaryth’s shining shield absorbed the blows rained down by the Forosilvuli champion, turning death to life. We gained magic, and the enemy lost heart. Our arrows found their flesh. We drove the Forosilvuli off, and their survivors left without looting our land. 

Erenlanth came into his own, as man and prince. Council said, "We can rule until he matures into the role." Fervent royalists objected. It was not willingness to rule, not maturity, but bloodline that determined all. 

We spotted a herd raid by the Kestangi. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without looting our land.


Venef 24
Our seers predicted that foragers would find less food than usual this year. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for half a season. 

Walktapi and other Chaos foes attacked. Calling on Humakt to guide her sword, Korestene entered a trance-like state, and rode through the Chaos army, striking to left and right. Finally, the attackers could take no more of this. They broke and ran. 

The Porganosi made a deal with cultists of the Chaos god Tyram the Broken. We sent Doresa out to look for eager Uroxi. She contacted an Uroxi band led by Oranth the Relentless. Not long after they returned carrying the severed heads of the Tyram cultists. As was their custom, they instructed us to support their mission with generous gifts. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for half a season. 

Hanvan and his party never returned from foraging to the clan lands. 

We were raided by the Ruby Gates. Poison clouds drifted down to the ground. Aski sought to summon an air elemental. An air elemental, which said it knew Orlanth when he still lived, appeared to oblige us. It blew the clouds away. He showed his disdain for fire worshipers by roughly buffeting our opponents. We drove the Ruby Gates off, and their survivors left without looting us. 

The Genadari requested a favor, asking for food since they were in the tribe. We offered cattle instead. They accepted this with ill grace. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

Rodene asked for Four Drum help in a joint ritual against Nontraya. They agreed to help avenge Ernalda. 

Council met to consider preparations for an attack by the Maker of Bad Growth. We asked the Four Drums to send divine sacrifices. They pledged sacrifices worth 20 cows. "Berenstead bears the brunt of Chaos, shielding the rest of the valley," they said. After departing Four Drum lands, Rodene was attacked, but returned home with her escort. 

The Jade Colts sent surprise aid, sacrifices worth as much as those sent by the Four Drums. The Maker of Bad Growth attacked, as had the Eater of Skin and the Author of Sores before it. It made 22 people sick. Korestene rode out to battle it. She did not know where to hit it, so she attacked it anywhere she could. Maggots leapt from the Maker’s wounds and burrowed into her. The light of Elmal surrounded Korestene, and she became his daughter Osara. The maggots burned out of Korestene, and when that happened, the Maker screamed. It fell into smaller bits and seeped back into the Gods War. The ring said, "Three monsters came for us, but could not kill our hope." Offir’s words stirred weary and frightened hearts. 

Rodene asked for Porganosi help in a combined ritual against Nontraya. They agreed to help the tribe. 

The Kestangi raided us. An Orlanthi champion flew up from the Kestangi ranks, but fell to earth, unable to draw breath. Intoning the words of Humakt, who said, "You were my brother, but now I am death," Aski led a determined push into Kestangi ranks. They fell before us. Feeling the weight of the Death Rune upon them, the Kestangi fled Berenstead, sure of our determination. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without looting us. 

We sent a mission to the Porganosi clan to request food in exchange for the favor they owed us. Rodene asked for a bit more food than custom demanded. They said that they could not spare the food, for their fortunes were bad.

Our market would be profitable this year, according to the omens. 

Three people starved to death. 

We found the remains of Hanvan’s exploration party. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for half a season. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for half a season. 

Thick ice covered our fields. We sought the aid of spirits. Fire spirits came and feasted on the ice. Our crops were no worse off than before. 

We sent a mission to the Genadari clan to request food in exchange for the favor they owed us. Rodene asked for a bit more food than custom demanded. Heorl, chief of the Genadari clan, agreed to give us the extra food we asked for. Some of his farmers seemed unhappy with our request. 

We sent a mission to the Urkarning clan to request food in exchange for the favor they owed us. We asked for three times the usual amount of food. Rodene beseeched Orstanor to aid us in our time of need. We said we would consider ourselves in debt to the Urkarnings for several favors, not one. Orstanor, chief of the Urkarning clan, agreed to give us the additional food. Many of his farmers seemed sorely affronted by our request. 

Bandit priests of the disease goddess Malia demanded tribute. We refused, then called on Chalana Arroy for aid. Our healers petitioned her, but she must have been helping those who needed her more. A wasting disease swept through the clan. People said we should have acceded to their demands. 

Illness swept through the clan. We called for healing spirits, which came and drove off the sendlings of Malia. 

When a season passed and no new trouble arose, we grew nervous. Then a shaft of sunlight broke through the dying sky. Leaders told the people to savor the moment. Looking at the bolt of sunlight that shone on our citadel, the people said, "After we beat Chaos, the whole sky will be blue and clear, as it was in the past." 

Rodene asked for Oro-Tagin help in a joint ritual against Nontraya. They agreed to help avenge Ernalda. 

The Kestangi raided us. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 


Venef 26
The remaining earth goddesses wanted us to raid this year. 

We slaughtered enough livestock that we could eat for a season. 

Hunters found a statue of Ragnaglar in our wildlands. Divination revealed that the statue had been dumped on our lands by the Urkarnings. We demanded that they retrieve their statue. Their council pleaded for our understanding. "The statue, it preyed on our minds, fogging our judgment!" The Urkarnings sent laborers to take the statue away. During the return journey from their lands, Rodene was attacked, but returned home with her escort. 

We raided the Kestangi. We drove the Kestangi from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for a season. 

The Genadari raided us. Minaryth found himself in a position to kill many of the foe. He took out a good number of them. Jade Colts came to reinforce our adversaries. Our Bows aimed at them and fired. Our arrows showed them the price of intervention. They pulled back, like the schemers they were. We drove the Genadari off, and their survivors left without looting us. 

We heard that the Genadari planned to annex uninhabited land near their territory. Nothing stood in our way as we occupied the empty stead. War leaders warned us to brace for a punitive raid from the Genadari. The additional farm and pasture land would increase our productivity. 

Uraldinna was wounded trying to climb a tree to reach a very large nest. 

The Urkarnings acknowledged the glory of the Chaos god Teghern. They chose the Blackspears as his victims, and he slew half their elite warriors. Rodene went to convince them to renounce Teghern. They said they already regretted what they had done, but could not see a way to atone. We said they had to outlaw the leaders who counseled the crime. With heavy hearts, their ring agreed. They departed swiftly, taking the stink of Chaos with them. We thought that the end of these troubles, until weeks later, when we learned that the former Urkarnings had turned to banditry. The elite of their clan, they proved fearsome in exile. 

We sent a mission to the Grey Wing clan to request food in exchange for the favor they owed us. Rodene asked for a bit more food than custom demanded. Tayrnak, chief of the Grey Wing clan, agreed to give us the extra food we asked for. Some of his farmers seemed unhappy with our request. 

A Star Captain called Harzalor sought our celestial fragments. We agreed. 

Our traders discovered that Jade Colt lands were missing. 

We were raided by the Genadari. A Genadari Humakti Death Lord advanced on Korstardos, to engage in single combat. He fought with Storm Bull’s fury. Korstardos went berserk, bowling down their champion and beating her to a pulp before finally finishing her. For good measure he rushed at the Humakti’s retinue, laying low junior devotees. We drove the Genadari off, and their survivors left without looting our land. 

Outlander Wheels offered to perform magic of Ompalam, greatly increasing our treasury, in exchange for ten people to be taken as slaves. They also wanted us to fly their banner. "Begone, wretches!" we cried. They performed an incantation to their cruel god. One of their slaves dissolved into a black fog, which drifted over our walls. Our god-talkers invoked Urox, the wind against Chaos, and Elmal, holder of the shield. The gods turned back the black fog, so it could not harm us. The Ompalamites slunk away. We took heart in our righteousness. 

In Vestenan, a local war band invited us to raid the Penentelli with them. We agreed. We stalked with the Vestantes to an evacuated community near the border between the two kingdoms. There we found ravening zombies. We soundly defeated them. Our share of the valuables we found searching empty Penentelli homes came out worth 33 cows.


Venef 27
The oracles said any children born this year would have great destinies. 

Devil cultists offered us a prayer to divert an imminent Chaos attack. We treated their offer with the scorn it deserved. As they left, they called out, "Wakboth shall feast on your livers!" People took heart in our refusal to be cowed. 

Shapestealers and other Chaos foes attacked. A scorpion queen broke from the pack of Chaos fiends to scuttle at Korestene. Korestene aimed for her thorax. A simple blow, aimed with fortitude, was all it took. Korestene drove her sword deep and true. The scorpion queen’s death sent a wave of mewling fear through the Chaos spawn. We pushed back our disoriented foes. This heralded their defeat. Soon their survivors were fleeing the field, none of the shapestealers able to take control. 

Misshapen devotees of Pocharngo, god of change, offered us great magic. We fired missiles from a safe distance. Our arrows pierced them with little effect. Weird smiles contorted their faces. They slouched off, singing a song in praise to Pocharngo. 

Teghern cursed us so that food would not slake our hunger, then offered to lift the curse in exchange for a song of praise. We attacked him. Our sudden ferocity took the Chaos god by surprise. Korestene’s sword nicked one of his trunk-like appendages. Perhaps because we had broken his concentration, the curse lifted, ending the debilitating hunger. That night Aski had a dream. The sole surviving Berensteader was lost and starving. And then Teghern came. 

Doresa led a caravan to trade with the Ku-Randeri. 

The Kestangi raided us for 25 cows. 

We raided the Kestangi, eluding their patrols. Janard found himself in a position to kill multiple foes. He cut down a good number of them. Erenlanth saw that the Kestangi had arrayed their missile force to deliver a fearsome fusillade. We charged. Their javelins felled nine in ten of us. No clan could withstand such a decisive blow. We were driven off and had no opportunity to pillage. 

Yinkin worshipers offered us a blessing against rats. We agreed. Phantom cats bolstered the efforts of our own alynxes. 

Two people starved to death. 

We foraged to the north and found enough food for about a season. 

Affronted by words of the king’s friends, Korestene announced that she would attract the undead to our lands, so she could slay them. The ring supported her with a sacrifice to Humakt. Our death cultists said Humakt had received their gift. More undead would come than if Korestene had performed the call without it, and her blade would be stronger against them. 

A world-hole leading to the divine realm was discovered to the east. Explorers sensed the powers of the Fire rune and a rune no one recognizes. 

Bandits threatened our foraging party in the northeast. Uraldinna convinced them that she was a powerful magician, and they departed. 

Uraldinna’s foraging party found a good place to forage. 

Voriof the shepherd god died in the formless mouths of Pocharngo the Gorpgod. We called on dying Voriof to bless our flock one last time. As he dissolved into cosmic cancer, Voriof ensured that sheep would survive here, if not elsewhere. 

Doresa led a caravan to trade with the Deleskarings. 

Korestene’s call to the undead brought skeletons to Berenstead. She hewed them down. The ring toasted Korestene in the royal hall. Venef and Aski praised her feat with special eloquence. 

Our neighbors the Urkarnings, who had been plagued by these skeletons before Korestene lured them away, sent sheep and pigs.


Venef 28
Our seers predicted that the hunters would find little game this year. 

Scorpion folk came to take our sheep. We went to other clans, encouraging them to establish patrols. Chiefs of nearby clans pledged to find and destroy these hungry foes. Soon we heard that the Urkarnings had intercepted and destroyed a scorpion folk raiding party. 

Two people died from starvation. 

We slaughtered enough livestock that we could eat for half a season. 

We were raided by the Forosilvuli. Poison clouds drifted down to the ground. Rodene called on Urox the Searing Wind. Urox had bigger worries than stupid clouds, and left us to handle the problem on our own. Rodene commanded that we should use the fog as cover. We tried to befriend the fog, but it did not befriend us. Both sides suffered, fighting in poor conditions, before it finally dissipated. We drove the Forosilvuli off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

A trader offered us a treasure that would strengthen us against the Grey Wings. We acquired it and gave it to the Grey Wings. They called this a generous gesture, worth far more to them than its value in goods. 

We sent a mission to the Porganosi clan to request food in exchange for the favor they owed us. Rodene asked for a bit more food than custom demanded. Orstalor, chief of the Porganosi clan, agreed to give us the extra food we asked for. Some of his farmers seemed unhappy with our request. 

The Kestangi raided us. As the battle started to turn our way, Rodene saw Kestangi thieves leaving our citadel with a treasure. She intercepted them. They fled before her might, dropping their prize, the Bone-Chewing Dog. But without Rodene to engage the foe, the main Kestangi force cut deeply into our defenders. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without looting our land. 

Weeders came to trade dried fish. We accepted, encouraging people to take heart in their survival. People found inspiration in the continuance of the famously put-upon Weeders. 

The death of Voriof turned elite warriors back into boys. We called on snake spirits to reverse this reversal. Snake spirits slithered up and bit their own tails. The boys turned back into men, and the people rejoiced. 

Chaos-marked zombies came in response to Korestene’s call; she slew them. The ring toasted the fallen shepherds in the royal hall. Janard and Aski recalled the slain with special poignancy. Their families celebrated the roles they had taken in the fight against the undead. 

Emissaries of the Ku-Randeri reported that these Chaos zombies had been harrying them. They opened a coffer containing 57 cows worth of gems and necklaces. 

Winter weather turned back our exploring party. 

Korestene sensed ghosts among our spirits, and proposed to call on Humakt to destroy them. Doresa said she was wrong. The ring admonished Korestene for spreading false fears. People were pleased to see the ring rein in our headstrong death-dealer. 

Winter weather turned back our exploring party. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for a season. 

Many worried that Erenlanth had fallen too far under the spell of Rodene. The rest of the ring said, "Rodene must use these journeys to teach him diplomacy." She agreed. Erenlanth learned to speak with greater care, and to hear others out. 

Aski died of old age.


Venef 29
The oracles predicted good foaling. 

Supporters wanted Minaryth to join the ring. The ring noted that Minaryth’s popularity was due to not having to deal with the daily business of the clan council. The ring’s disapproval only bolstered Minaryth’s support. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

The Trolls raided us. Janard found himself able to kill many of the foe. He struck down a good number of them. The trolls brought a gigantic mantis onto the battlefield. It ate one of our Bows. Erenlanth attacked the shamans. Erenlanth rode through the guard protecting the shamans. He cut down one, scattering the others. Before wandering off, the mantis snacked for a while on the corpse of nearest fallen troll. We drove the Trolls off, and their survivors left without plundering our land. 

Uraldinna and her party never returned from foraging to the north. 

The last members of the Ku-Rander clan sought to integrate into our clan. We invited them to stay as working guests. 

We raided the Andaylings, eluding their patrols. We drove the Andaylings from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

We performed the Decade Rite. We sought protection from herd loss. Elmal granted this. 90 cows appeared immediately in our pastures. 

The Kestangi raided us. We drove the Kestangi off, and their survivors left without looting our land. 

In the final stage of her call to the undead, Korestene slew a vampire, but Doresa was hurt, and three warriors slain. The king memorialized the slain in the clan hall. The people saluted the glorious fallen, imagining the welcome they would receive in divine Orlanthstead. 

With toasts still ringing in our ears we received visitors from the Genadari clan. The vampire had lately slain their chieftain, and they had sworn vengeance against it. As they could no longer spill blood to end its miserable existence, they did the next best thing, gifting us with gold and gems. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for a season. 

Shepherds spotted intruders before they could steal our lambs. We complained to the Urkarning clan. They showed us the corpses of Chaos folk, who they had slain sometime after their trespass onto our pastures. "These are frightening times," they said, "so we will forgive your baseless accusation." 

Wakboth the Devil pulled a star from the sky, hurling it into another valley clan. Offir identified the murdered god as Geyzenturas the Word Star. Then our tongues began to fail us. We performed a divination to see which god might help. Our god-talkers drew Redalda’s rune in the sand. She had previously assumed the duties of dead gods, and cared much for communication between clans. Given time we might work out a rite to end this itaa t’d’hhomlmnk. Poisoned air drifted from the crater where the star had died. It spared our animals but slew our people. We tore our garments and ra be hoglnjbg. 

Korstardos and his party never returned from exploring to the east. 

Emissaries from the Deleskaring clan had a complaint, or demand, but we could no longer understand them. We attacked them. We slew their leader and drove off the others, teaching them who was diholarim and who was smebkarslr. Only three of our warriors were hurt.


Venef 30
The oracles thought there would be few sting-flies. 

Ogres and other Chaos foes attacked. Korestene led the defense from inside Berenstead. We kept a few of our warriors in reserve, assigning the rest to the walls. With grappling hooks and climbing magic, the ogres made it to the top of the wall. The ogres were seasoned veterans. Ultimately we drove them back down. 

We slaughtered enough livestock that we could eat for a season. 

Rodene readied a rite to restore language as we know it. We asked nearby clans to help. It was hard to convey the request without recognizable words, but Rodene finally got through to them, and they agreed. Rodene rode in circles, leaping between two horses, chanting the nonsense words that clotted our tongues. Suddenly these became recognizable speech. First Rodene could talk properly, then all of us. We sensed that others would also be spared this terrible blight. The people celebrated Rodene’s miracle-working prowess, and the contribution of our neighbors. 

We raided the Andaylings, eluding their patrols. Janard found himself in a position to kill multiple foes. He struck down many of them. We drove the Andaylings from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their lands. 

Talokan demons attacked us. We fought them off. We scoured the wildlands for remaining talokans. Erenlanth found a remnant force of the demons and led the attack. We finished the talokan stragglers, showing them a second time we were no easy target. Only one of our warriors was hurt. 

The Ar-Tarima clan sought our partnership in gathering gold from the crater where the Sky Racer clan once lived. We nodded our agreement, sending four warriors to protect the Ar-Tarima gold gatherers. 

We were raided by the Forosilvuli. We drove the Forosilvuli off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 

Ergeshites offered us a supply of dried goat meat. We attacked them. They fell easily beneath our raging blades. Only five of our warriors were hurt. We gathered up their tubs of goat jerky. 

Our emissaries discovered that Kestangi lands were completely empty of people. 

Hoarders took grain from the storehouse. The ring made a show of forgiveness. The people praised the ring’s mercy. "The hoarders grievously erred, but in a way that all of us can feel for." 

A skeletal herald of undeath informed us that Humakt was dead and challenged Korestene to a duel. She stepped forward to duel the herald. They traded rattling blows, Korestene’s sword sparking black when bronze hit bone. Finally, with a blow like the arc of the sun, Korestene broke Undeath’s Herald to bits. The skeleton escort fled. When we rushed to embrace heroic Korestene, we saw the fatal wound in her side. Korestene passed her sword to the king. "When all else is gone, hold on to this," she gasped. "Let my memory bring you…" 

A vampire attacked Rodene. Offir killed the monster, but Rodene would become one of them if we didn’t take steps. We called on spirits to heal the vampire sickness. Spirits entered Rodene’s body, swimming in her veins, crushing the hundreds of tiny vampires coursing through her. 

Harvar and his party never returned from foraging to the northeast. 

Bandits threatened our foraging party in the northwest. Randella convinced them that she was a powerful magician, and they departed. 

The Andaylings raided us. Offir found himself in a position to kill multiple foes. He struck down many of them. We drove the Andaylings off, and their survivors left without plundering us. 


Venef 31
We were unable to bless our clan’s health during Sacred Time. 

Offir’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level. 

The horizon died. The end was nigh. We warned allies. "We feared as much," chieftains said, "but if Berenstead says it is so, no doubt remains." 

The gold-hunting expedition to the Sky Racer crater ended with our escort dead, apparently due to a fight over cursed gold. The Ar-Tarimae paid us wergild. 

We foraged to the northwest and found enough food for about half a season. 

Our crops failed due to a killing frost. We planted a second crop. 

We reorganized the clan ring. 

We slaughtered enough livestock that we could eat for a season. 

Rodene asked for Andayling help in a combined ritual against Nontraya. They agreed to help avenge Ernalda. 

A walktapus got into the citadel and snatched a child. We called on Urox. The mark of the winged bull appeared on our citadel wall. 

We slaughtered enough livestock that we could eat for half a season. 

Devotees of Xhas, Goddess of Equilibrium, wanted us to raid the Porganosi in exchange for 22 horses and 110 cows. We declined. With an insinuating look, their leader said, "You’ll regret this." Venef went to warn their target. They thanked us for the warning. Their god-talkers theorized that this so-called Xhas was imaginary. Our visitors sounded more like devotees of Seseine, Chaotic goddess of temptation. 

A gorp seized a young palace attendant, Felbarntar. We called on Urox. Our bull stompers snorted and grunted. They said that the next time Chaos slavered at us, we would not be caught flat-footed. 

Rodene asked for Ar-Tarima help in a joint ritual against Nontraya. They agreed to help. 

Minaryth asked for Blackspear help in a combined ritual against Nontraya. They weren’t interesting in fighting Chaos. 

The eye of Wakboth filled the sky. We sought aid from other clans. Clans who worshiped Urox sent their own bull stompers. Those who did not sent sacrifices, and bolstered us with magic. Lifted by the aid of the valley clans, our bull stompers successfully invoked Urox, who sent the eye away. Though far from final, this victory would grant surcease for a time, at least. 

Our foraging trip to the land where the Ku-Randeri once lived did not go well. 

Erenlanth returned from a fight with Chaos cultists, injured, berserker’s fire in his eyes. The ring asked Erenlanth to assure the people. "Let cowards mind their own business!" he cried, before passing out against the citadel wall. 

We slaughtered enough livestock to feed the clan for a season. 

A group of Forosilvuli asked for temporary shelter. We granted hospitality. That night we heard horrible shrieks from Offir’s quarters. The travelers were ogres in disguise. They fell upon Offir and began tearing at his flesh with knife-sharp teeth. Offir activated defensive magic and fought back. As others came in response to his groans of agony, the ogres fled. Though badly wounded, Offir would recover, in time. 

We sent a mission to our allies, the Porganosi clan, to ask for food. Rodene asked for no more and no less than the usual amount. The Porganosi provided us with the food without complaint. 

We realized that the widow Valensta was dead, despite still tending to her two young children. We told her she was dead. No one could make out what her rotting tongue said, but clearly she didn’t agree. We called on Yinkin, god of cats, to shoo them off. Translucent black alynxes joined our own cats. Nipping and yowling, they drove Valensta into the wildlands. She was never seen again. 

Striking a deal with foreign priestesses, the Ar-Tarimae received 100 cows for attacking their allies, the Deleskarings. We sent Rodene to the Deleskarings to propose an alliance. They said stout allies were needed more than ever. The Deleskaring god-talkers had identified the priestesses as worshipers of Seseine, Chaos goddess of temptation. Together we would fight her, and all of her ilk. 

Offir stopped living, but didn’t really die. 

Erenlanth’s combat skill was acknowledged to be of heroic level.


Finale
The oracles predicted the end of the world. The ancestors despaired that the world would soon perish. 

At Berenstead, betrayal and strife heralded the world’s end. Chaos did not kill us. We killed each other. Only Rodene survived. She took the one thing that still mattered, the last healthy horse. 

For a time beyond measure Rodene traversed a dead and ruined world. To keep her mind intact, Rodene made a series of bets with her horse. As they plodded through the deteriorating world, she and the horse both grew skilled at wagering. Fortunately Rodene had no other property except for the animal, and thus nothing to lose. Nor did anything exist that either wished to win. Yet if Rodene ever again met anyone worth bargaining with, she would be ready. 

Rodene beheld a glowing entity that might have been an infant, and an outland Orlanthi who demanded to know the secret of the Second Son. Rodene said, "You are the Second Son." The strange hero nodded. "I must indeed be the one chosen to break the back of Chaos. I am Heort, and in my veins runs the blood of Orlanth the King, and his son Vingkot the Champion." 

Rodene met ghosts arguing with raccoon people, their dispute so fierce that it poisoned the air. She told them the story of how Redalda took up Issaries’s talking stick. "You mean that talking heals the world, and shouting wounds it?" the ghosts said. "Look!" exclaimed the raccoon folk. "We’re killing the last few animals!" Filled with understanding, the two sides agreed to discuss the matter calmly, until they came to an accord. 

Ragged survivors bowed down to Rodene, promising worship in exchange for leadership. She said, "I shall lead you to victory." They lifted her up on their shoulders, calling her Rodene the Great and Rodene the Magnificent. She swept with them across the disintegrating world, raiding enemies and commanding the obedience of the weak. After a timeless time, these blood-mad battles claimed the lives of all these warriors, leaving Rodene alone again to wander. 

Rodene came upon the Last Mare, dying in a swamp. "Without horses," Rodene said, "the world will not be worth living in, even if it does survive." Last Mare agreed, finding the strength and will to free herself from the hungry muck. 

The Chaos god Teghern offered Rodene relief from hunger. "I’d sooner eat my horse," Rodene said. "Suit yourself," Teghern laughed. "It’s not as if you’ll need it for anything else." 

Rodene found elves making a nutritious paste. She said, "All who live must strive as one." "Our kind has been ill-treated by yours, and we sense fire within you, which burns us. But no good plant will live if the weed of Wakboth is not torn out." They let Rodene eat some of the paste, and she was rejuvenated. 

Rodene brushed into the web of an enormous spider. She lunged for the web. The spider smiled and wrapped her from head to toe in sticky, constricting silk. "Every hero is half a fool," she said, "but that web is existence itself, and you would casually destroy it? You are a fool seven times over!" "This web is nice," she said, "but I bet you can’t weave the world back." "How dare you?" the spider sputtered. "If you think you’re so smart, I’ll make you reweave the world!" Rodene took the spider’s silk and did what she could to make something from it. After a very long time, she mastered the art of weaving. To the spider’s pleasure, Rodene remade the world. Not only far places she had only an inkling of, but the valley, and the river, and Berenstead, too. The spider armed Rodene with a sword and a spear and a bow, and said, "Take those gifts to Wakboth, why don’t you?" 

The gods of Chaos fought to stamp out all sign of new growth. Among the horde, Teghern spotted Rodene and barreled toward her. "Other Chaos gods are fiercer than you," said Rodene, "or greater in power, or crueler. But you are the worst, for you used the ordinary weaknesses of people as weapons to destroy them." Rodene continued to invoke the values we lived by. "But in the end, when you wanted us to fear, we kept finding reasons to hope." Teghern shook and trembled. And at that moment, Rodene realized that she was Ginna Jar, the last companion dead Orlanth would need to live again and restore the world. Teghern wailed in fright, begging to be spared. But the truth of Rodene’s new form emerged from her as a bolt, which blasted the Chaos god. Teghern was forever dead, and would be lost among the long list of forgotten Gods War casualties. Never would he trouble the reborn world. 

Rodene became one with Heort and fought the assembled gods of Chaos, giving them their first decisive defeat. As a gift, Rodene claimed power over the hidden and mysterious. 

Rodene returned to the rewoven world to find Berenstead partly intact, and Star Dancers yet alive. 

We fought the Unity Battle, forming a particular bond with elves. Together the gathered peoples of Dragon Pass shattered the Undead Army. Storm Bull buried Wakboth the Devil forever beneath a giant block of stone. A Grey Age followed, as the world gradually regained its vigor. Venef the Stallion ruled Berenstead with a wisdom forged at the Unity Battle. 

When the fullness of the sun was at last restored to the sky, and our gods came back to life, we knew that none of it would have happened without the Star Dancer clan. We would always remember how we defeated Chaos, undoing the destruction of the world.
