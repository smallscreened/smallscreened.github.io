<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I am not sure what to put here, but I want to do *something* about storing music thoughts, recommendations, etc. somewhere, and this is a place I *could* do it.

What I know I have right now is my top picks of albums and singles from 2022, so I can share that here <a href="https://smallscreen.info/music/2022">https://smallscreen.info/music/2022</a></p>
