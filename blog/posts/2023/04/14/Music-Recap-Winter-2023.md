### Music Recap: Winter 2023
So I've been proceeding forward with my plan to [add everything I listen to this year into a single playlist](https://elekk.xyz/@campbell/109609703169030560). I am a YouTube Premium patron, so that's where I'm housing everything, and since you're here in this space reading this you can [take a peek at it and listen yourself](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTm1tn5YD5gLaxGIMNSTAGI8-6SUl4BYn). I'm going to just keep adding things here, but just know as of this writing the list is the first 1,041 items.

At the same time, YouTube Music also is continuing to do a poor impression of Spotify Wrapped on what seems like a seasonal basis. It's a neat idea, but the way YouTube Music doesn't read any information from stuff I might listen to on YouTube Video makes it a weirdly skewed thing. Figured it was worth sharing though, as it's not entirely wrong at summing up my listening habits.

I did indeed get back into Nine Inch Nails in a big way through they winter. I've always liked them, but every time I revisit them their music really grows on me. Otherwise a lot of my listening was dance music tuned for running as I'm currently training for a race (and need my running playlist on point), [Caroline Polachek's latest album](https://album.link/y/PLSyWCtnp4AuodCGqesPd4wW4wlHPLQMNi) which I find to be very enjoyable pop music, and a fair amount of Elderbrook because I went to see him live last month. Probably the most brow-raising part of this analysis is the playlists because I don't usually listen to music via playlists in YouTube Music so I think it grabbed the only three things I clicked on. [Extrawelt is some really great stuff](https://album.link/y/PL8A2CFF335FD4273A), though.
